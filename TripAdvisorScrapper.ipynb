I stayed in at least 4 other hotels as well during my 2 week stay in Bali and we always came back here for the above reasons. The staff were what made it such a joy to stay at, and also really sad to leave. Whether it was the girls on the front desk or the guys who cleaned the rooms or ran the bar, everyone was so friendly and welcoming. Special thanks to Adnyana (Bojes) for making it a really pleasant stay for us. I would love to thank other staff too, but I cannot remember the names! Definitely will be coming back here. Awesome access for the airport and also only a mid length walk or very short motorbike journey to legian street for the clubs.\n",

Very near to Pantai and Serangan beach, Kuta beach is also not so far2. Discovery Mall, Lippo Mall and Coco Mart is just a few walk away. 3. Bali Water Bom Water Park is also walking distance away. 4. Have numerous Indian, Chinese, Bali, Japanese restaurants closeby5. Local Market, Souvenir Shops, Tour guides for Day tours, Shopping complex, Money exchanges, Bars and Pubs are closeby. 6. Ngurah Rai international airport is just 2.8 Kms from the hotel. Food : 4.5/5 StarBuffet Breakfast is given complimentary and includes lot of varieties in Asian, Continental, Veg and Non VegRoom : 4/5 StarRooms are compartively smaller for a superior room and have a bit of smell of dampness, which goes away as soon as you switch on the room power.Note that room ambience, linen, towels, lighting, furniture, electrical appliances gives it a premium look. Room AC, Hot/ Cold Water in the room is working just perfect.Swimming Pool is big and very clean, clean towels are provided.The alleyway's were calm and silent and also there was no sound or noise from neighbouring rooms, which was definitely plus.Spa and Massage : This hotel provides inhouse spa and massage service and costs about 125K IDR/ hour for full body massage including taxes.Wi-fi : 4/5 StarWi-fi works quite good in room, washroom, alleyway and swimming pool area but the speed can be improved further.All in all an excellent stay, you won't regret booking this hotel.\n",

The pool was great as there were not a lot of people swimming in it, which I liked.The room was kept very clean. The bathroom is so small though and I think you need to install an exhaust fan in there. The breakfast I found was not the best so we only went down a couple of times. The other thing was that even though there was a small sign saying Quite Please in the corridors it was so noisy at night with other travellers being disrespectful, slamming doors and talking in the corridor out loud in the middle of the night. But overall we had a good stay there.\n",

      "  review_body : Overall nice hotel with friendly staff.Good location near Lippo mall Kuta and Waterbom. However, beware of Karma group agents who are everywhere in the streets, preying on couples trying to give away their scam 'hotel stay prizes'.The buffet breakfast was nice but a bit lacking in variety.The Superior room was visibly aging and was not well lit but we were pleased by the bed set up with swan towels and a rose on the occasion of our wedding anniversary. Most unfortunately, we faced an issue with the shower in our room upon check in: dirt was coming up from the drain and a very bad smell was emanating from there making it impossible to take a shower! The front office was immediately contacted and they sent a maintenance guy, who could not fix the problem and who suggested that he cleaned the shower square so that we could shower. We blatantly refused as the smell was pungent and whatever was blocking the drain would surely come up again and requested to switch rooms. The guy said he would check with his boss. A few minutes later we received a call from front office telling us that a replacement room would not solve the problem as water spills out from the shower squares in all rooms. Apparently, the actual problem was being misunderstood or passed off for mere water spilling from the shower square, so we argued that pungent smelling gross dark dirt would hopefully not be coming up from the drain of showers in all their rooms. Someone from the front office then came up to the room with the maintenance guy and stated that he would find a replacement room for us and that we can check out the shower first. We indeed did and while water spilled a bit out of the shower, there was no dirt nor bad smell coming up the drain. The room was a bit smaller but we moved pomptly with the help of the front office guy. He apologised for the inconvenience caused and told us that he would have the shower fixed in our previous room. But we spent our whole stay in the smaller room itself without anyone making mention of the problem again. Overall we had a nice stay at the hotel despite the problem encountered on our first night and appreciated that front office was very responsive and helpful in resolving the situation. While we would rate the service as 'Very Good' , we can rate our stay as merely 'Good' and suggest thorough maintenance and renovation of rooms.\n",

They have security by the entrance monitoring a safe stay for the resort guests. Large selection of food available in the menu delivered to your room including any special or dietary requests.I would like to say very special thanks to Adnyana for his excellent customer service, decent company and great conversations, trip advising and his suggestions on places to visit in Bali depending on what you like. Adnyana usually works in the bar by the pool and will make you any drink you like exactly how you want it. Out of four barman I have met here Adnyana is the best one by far... Make sure you try one of his famous Mojitos which are perfect every time.\n",

      "  review_body : Stayed for 2 nights at Grand Ixora and it was an average stay. The hotel is almost 2 kms from the Kuta beach and all good places and pubs are near the beach. There are only shops around this hotel and a couple of malls. Since on a holiday, we did not want to visit the mall, this was not a convenient location for us. All the good restaurants are almost a km walk away. You can choose to stay here if you are planning to rent a scooter or a cab even to go small distances. We chose Kuta as one of the locations only to visit the famous Tanah Lot and Uluwatu temples so thankfully did not spend a lot of time at the hotel. The rooms are small but the bed is comfy and you get all the basic amenities. The staff is courteous and the buffet breakfast was also good.\n",

It cost for a double and you can have either queen bed or two singles. For the price it was great. Plenty of shops in the middle of Kuta with lots of shopping places without having to go too far.i normally stop in a hotel twice the price but will go back to this hotel again as I said it is in the heart of whatever you want. It has a very nice pool and great breakfast for $7.50 Australian. Try it and you won’t be let down especially price wise and functionality.\n",

The rooms are a good size and quite new looking, but could do with some upkeep in the bathroom, even though the hotel is not that old. The staff on reception weren’t as attentive as they could have been and we were left waiting while another guest was served ahead of us. The breakfast was adequate, with the staff in the restaurant not very attentive either. We enquired about room service and asked for a bottle of wine, they brought about a glassful in the bottom of a bottle and said that’s all they have as wine wasn’t asked for much. This hotel would only be worth staying for a short period of time like we did, to catch an early flight.\n",

      "  review_body : We stayed for 2 days, a stop over from KL to Makassar. Nice “senior” hotel with good maintain.We took 2 superior rooms, supposed to be connected but due to fully booked, they gave us face to face room (which each rooms has a locked connected door)Superior room’s size was normally small but still has a space to put our big luggages below the tv. Lightning a bit low, we have to open the curtain to have a light in the day, and for night it’s a best ambience for fall asleep. Bed was big and comfy, although the pillows a bit hard for me. But still can sleep well. Superior bathroom was small. But ameneties are complette.Better took pool access room (available with superior and deluxe type) for totally way to swim and sunbathing. Breakfast was so so, beside western and asian they also serve indian food and vegetarian food.Hotel itself is in main street of jalan Kartika so you can find everything for just a few steps. Lippo mall, Discovery mall, Bali Art shop, eateries like Bebek Tepi Sawah, and banks and ATM. A good location hotel with very good price, well maintained bedroom and very nice staff.\n",

Fittings in the bathroom are corroded. AC far too cold and can`t be adjusted much. The only really good thing about the hotel is the happy staff.\n",

      "  review_body : Since the first moment I understood that this hotel is ridiculous !!So this is the story:Booked online for a anniversary trip with my boyfriend, in Bali, 5 night in B&B accommodation with 1 day spa and a romantic indonesian dinner in set menu.Book everything online, INCLUDING pick up and drop off from the airport (10 min away) and \"honeymoon treatment\" (that wasn't included but to pay as extra), and paid EVERITHING in the first day.-1 day, arrive with 4 hours of delay, cause airplane problem at 11.50pm (so you can imagine my mood)And as first thing the receptionist ask me to pay the driver cash, and the amount for the all stay immediately.Obviously, we said that we were just landed and we didn't have any cash, so after a good 10 min of talking with the driver in their language, he said that we could pay him the following day, so already stressed we went to the room.No body show us the room was like \"get your luggage and arrange your self\" but was fine.Stepped in the room the disaster. -the \"famous honeymoon tratment\" wasn't there.  -towel were just 2, big, and dirty! But like if someone has pii on it. So we ask to change it. -mini fridge empty. (?) -water boiler and TV broken. -AC was weak, when was on it was 16° when off 35°, it didn't has a middle way. -Wi-Fi lunatic. It works just when it wants, if you can connect to it.And than-in 5 days we had to ask 3 time to make up the room, because at 3pm wasn't done yet.-the second day we ask for the \"honeymoon treatment\" (because we paid for it) and the answered:\"Sorry there was a mistake, today you will have it...\"But nothing again, no even the following day, we had to wait for the last one, after that we spoak with the manager and ask if we could have it at least in our anniversary day.-the spa treatment was fine, not at European standard but I won't aspect that.But than they asked me to pay everything again because they have lost the payment. Argue with the receptionist, argue with the manager and when we show them the email with the confirm of payment, credit card recivit and the holly spirit, they did apologise and let us go.-but the best was the \"private romantic dinner\" on our anniversary day.Sited at this beautiful table pool side, But that table wasn't for us, one other mistake, sorted out, left there for good 10 min. And as soon the waiter has come we asked to be move in the restaurant because the pool was still full of child a.d peapole swimming, splashing and shouting around(7:30pm). Moved in the restaurant the drink propose were 3/4 kind of cocktail( the classics they said) , or a paper brick \"local\" wine. At this time all the atmosfear was gone!Starter, mixed leaf salad,First course a tomato soup,And when they ask for the main course they said that was the western menu, but we book for the Indonesian one. sorry... apologise... ecc. So at the end the chef sent to us the Balinese traditional soup and the Indonesian main course.Fresh fruits and a very nice cake to finish the meal. And also thanks to the waitress, that was kind and she try to sort out all that problem. After have ruin our anniversary holidays, on the check out what is happened ??? More problem..!!!On the second day we show them the online receive of the pick up from the airport already paid when I did the booking, but on the check out it doesn't come out so we had to pay it again.! And the drop off wasn't even on the sistem.So at the end we just left the money, and we went to the airport by foot. 0 organization 0 professionality Definitely not again and NOT suggested.\n",

Suggest to rent a motorbike for easy coverage. The room was a bit small but i love the way they decorated the bed. It is clean and comfortable too. Staffs were also friendly and checking in was at a breeze. Overall, my husband and I enjoyed the hospitality and the price was so cheap for this kind of hospitality.

      "  review_body : We stayed here for one night to avoid the traffic jams going to the airport.Located only 10 mins from the airport and right in between Lippo mall and Centro.Hotel staff were very helpful and friendly. Breakfast met its purpose, just an average buffet. The spa was fantastic, fabulous massage on the final day before the flight home.Rooms are small, but served their purpose and were clean.Represents good value for money and located close to the malls made it a worthwhile stay for a night.\n",

      "  review_body : I stayed here from 19/02/2018 to 22/02/2018. Well looking at the hotel it looks like a very common hotel like others but the amenities, the location makes the hotel a perfect destination for couples. The hotel is located just 10 Min from the international airport. And it's also located in the heart of the kuta city. It has a very good pool. All the staff are very helpful and friendly. We were very much happy with the hospitality given to us. The restaurant is also very good with limited Indian menu. Still one should not worry about food in this location. Just after you move out of the hotel you vl find lots of Indian restaurants at walking distance. One more benefit of staying in this hotel is it's exactly located between 2 malls Lippo and discovery mall. Just walking distance of 200-300 mtrs. This hotel provides you with toothbrush, paste towel soap shampoo as well. Hotel everyday provides you with 2 half ltr water bottles. The rooms and the toilet were very clean. We also had the honeymoon flower arrangement which was done quite well. Only the negative things are the size of the rooms is small. Some people had reviewed that there are no English channels shown in TV, but I never used TV as der is much more to be seen visited in Bali. This hotel also has in house spa( I didn't use it though) and looked nice. The rates of the spa are in dollars and dats the case in all the spas in Bali. Overall I was very happy about my stay in grand ixora kuta resort. I vl definitely visit again if I travel to Bali. \n",

      "  review_body : Booked this hotel because when we read the reviews initially, it sounds like real value for money in the heart of the kuta tourism district. To our delight, it was not only nearby to the airport but nearby to plenty of amenities including malls, banks and massages at our doorsteps.We arrived at an ungodly hour, so, a hotel close to denpasar was an important requirement and a necessity. It ticked all the right boxes on top of many other plus points to go along with it. The bed was comfy and the toilet is clean. The one thing why we read reviews in tripadvisor and other sites is to browse & zero in on toilet cleanliness. If a hotel can keep it’s toilets clean, it generally gives a great overall impression on the hotel service. Although the room size and the toilet size is rather economical, you get what you pay for and the location, service and cleanliness more than makes up for it. We spent a couple of hours in the pool but most of our time is spent away from the hotel. The lippo mall nearby has live music from 9pm onwards with open air ambience. Here, we are able to enjoy ordering food from various cafe stalls nearby and as far as the ayam penyet or bebek (duck) paket from the food court on the 2nd floor of the mall. Music was good and there seems to be a small expatriate crowd following the band during the nights we were there. The discovery mall is bigger shopping centre with loads of stuff. It has plenty of restaurants and even a chillout party place by the sea. Other amenities nearby is the massage outlets on offer. I managed to sneak in a haircut at danny’s hair stylist shop nearby (he’s good!) and my missus went to 2 separate massages on 2 different nights. On one of those occasions, i booked a simple hour of facial treatment which covers light facial massages too. Would i stay in this hotel again? For that price, i would give a big, hell yeah!! We felt a tinge of regret that we only booked via agoda, at an excellent price for 2 nights to test out the hotel and it’s facilities. When we tried to extend our hotel stay for another night, the price at the counter and on the website was already 20-30% higher. *Sigh*. All in all, well done grand ixora kuta for providing excellent basic hotel facilities and service!\n",

In Ixora I met with Mr Budianto Susanto or he usually called Kiun-kiun (朱钧權). He is like a idol @ ixora. He comes from Jakarta Pusat (Menteng), town where I lived and he could speak 3 languages. He is quite fluent in Mandarin because he studied in Taiwan. It didn't take long tim for us to quickly become friends, He is so kind and helpful giving me lot of help during my stay in there. I think Ixora is very lucky to have him as employee. It is very recommended hotel and I will love to refer it to my friends and families as their destination to stay when in Bali\n",

We are always greeted with a smile day and night, all staff were always willing to help you out. The food is great and the chef , Arim along with his Kitchen stuff were fantastic. Also all the reception stuff along with the general manager Budi were always making sure that we were comfortable. Even the security guards were always nice and helpful. The rooms are good size and always clean and the pool is nice and kids friendly. Great location also.It's definitely good value for money. I was there alone in September and my family used it in October and this time we had a group of 24 and stayed for 16 days and they all loved it. I will definitely be staying there again on my next visit to Bali. \n",

I think most of their local people stay in this hotel and I saw many. They have a nice pool but mostly noisy with the children and their local resident. If you need a good sleep, don’t ask for the pool view. The air condition isn’t good enough to have a sound sleep. We had a difficult sleep due to the centralized air condition(may be some of the rooms are good) It’s quite close and 3 minutes walk to shopping mall where you can enjoy your dinner with music live band at night. Near to the hotel, they have local trusted bank where I always change money.Don’t trust to their local small exchange counter where they offer higher rate - they tried to cheat me for $200. \n",

The staff are fantastic and always friendly, The beds are extreamly them so anyone with a sore back may struggle. Breakfast is very basic for westerners, omelettes seems to be your safest choice, I personally don’t include it and go down to bread talk or Starbucks for breakfast. My only issues which has been constant is the music at night time, the music is played too loud at night, 10pm onwards the music should be turned down very low or even off as some guests are trying to sleep! :( I loved the honeymoon display they did on our bed! \n",

The location is a walk away from Kuta Square and the restaurants over there but pretty close to the airport.The bed is comfortable but hard. The TV and WIFI are great. The AC/ventilation is very week. The rooms are small and even after i kept the curtains closed the temperature didnt go down fast and low. You might say this is more healthy or as I claim underdimensioned as the AC only work as you have the keycard in place to power up the room.Didn't enjoy there breakfast but looked nice. The staff is kind and professional. Arrived almost two hours early and didnt expect to get my room but it was ready and I got in without extra charge and the cleaning of the room is quick. I think the hotel is great if youre celebrating somethings and want to spend it at a nice hotel that wont be ruining you.Overall a nice hotell.\n",

They were moved to the ground floor (we were on the top floor) in a very quiet hotel. The rooms are much smaller than the pictures indicate and the bathrooms not very clean. Service was extremely slow every time we ordered room service. On one occasion we waited over an hour for two cups of coffee, rang to remind them and waited another 40mins until they arrived cold. We were still expected to pay for them. The pool receives little sunlight due to its position and it is always cold. I certainly would not recommend this hotel for more than a night or two in transit. Not a comfortable, or family friendly place.\n",

Discovery shopping mall is just 5-7 mins walk away and waterbom (one of the largest water park in the asia) is right across the street of Discovery shopping mall. There a lot of restaurants located in this street. If anyone is traveling with family and/or friends and looking for a budget hotel I recommend this hotel to stay.\n",

Also, only 5 minutes drive from the airport which is always good.The pool is fantastic, we enjoyed it almost every night after a day out. The room had a big size, bed was comfy and we couldn't ask for much more.CONS:Breakfast was a bit expensive so we didn't have it at all. The food at the restaurant wasn't good at all, and the dishes sizes are very small for the price paid. Overall it is a nice place to stay, we even came back for a second stay because it was so conveniently located. Highly recommended.\n",

      "  review_body : We visited Bali in the beginning of August this year and stayed in this property at Kuta. This property has a great location. A bank right opposite to the hotel across the road made it very convenient for us for the money exchange. The staff was quite humble and we had a smooth check in. The pool at the backside and the breakfast are in the front lobby was greatly managed and designed. There was a pool view almost from every room I suppose. The breakfast though had limited options for vegetarian but the staff was very nice to specially take my order and make either veg noodles or veg rice (mei goreng) for me yet again without egg or any chicken for continous 5 days . The rooms were comfortable and bathrooms were spic and span. Moreover being in the main street of Kuta made it accessible for us to wander around even during late nights. a special parking area for the rented scooters for the tourists was also available in the basement. We had plans to visit Waterbom as well. To our surprise it was just at a 10 minutes walking distance from this hotel. Luckily we saved on our pick and drop for waterbom. This property has a great advyof the location as well as the services are pretty amazing. \n",

When we first time arrived in Grand Ixora Kuta Resort, we were welcomed by Mr. Budianto Susanto (Ko Kiun Kiun). It turns out that his home is in Central Jakarta, near my home. He can speak English and Mandarin, and also very welcoming and helpful. The hotel room we stayed was also very cozy and clean. The part of the hotel that I like most is the swimming pool. Even I did not swim during my stay, but the ambience and the view of this hotel swimming pool were very good. There are also ATM and convenience store next to the hotel, so you don't need to worry if you run out of cash and need some snacks. This hotel is very recommended for you who want to feel the 4-star hotel quality with 3-star hotel price.\n",

The excuse given no rooms were available but guests were checking out everyday and our request could have been easily facilitated, it ruined our stay felt like sleeping in hostel beds.The Wi-fi is absolutely poor no chance of getting any signal even in the reception, only during late evening one was able to use the Wi-fi.

      "  review_body : You either love or hate Kuta. It's very westernised, its busy and we had avoided it on our previous visits to Bali. We gave it a go on our recent trip and we were quite pleasantly surprised.The Grand Ixora is placed very close to WaterBom, very conveniently placed between the Lippo and Discovery Shopping Malls, restaurants galore, and a ten minute walk to the beach. It is on a busy road and you could pass it without noticing it. A long thin reception area, a little bit soulless. The reception staff were either extremely friendly and competent or abrupt. The room was very comfortable. The corridors were tired.The swimming pool was a fair size, surrounded by the high walls of the hotel, so in shade from about 3pm onwards. Comfortable sun beds and hotel towels supplied. Breakfast was buffet style with a wide international selection. After breakfast the restaurant appeared to be empty.The real plus point would be the hotels location for shops and the WaterBom Park.\n",

      "  review_body : I was booked into the Grand Ixora by my travel agent. From the pictures and review on the hotel, it looks good. But here is my experience:Arrived at the hotel for check in in the late afternoon, it took some time for the Hotel to process our check in. Took them about 20 minutes. Once we were given the key, there was no information as to which elevator to use or where is our room so we took the nearest elevator to the designated floor. There was a electronically locked door to access the rooms on the floor and our key card does not work hence I have to go down to reception to get it authorized. After the keycard opened the electronic door, to our surprise we had to climb a 6 steps stairs to get to a room with no walkway to drag our luggage up hence we had to carry our huge and heavy luggage up the stairs. We found our room and it was situated just on top of the lounge where the singer and the band was blasting away. We can hear the music from inside the room. Went to reception to request for a change of room but they informed me that the hotel is fully booked and that the music will stop at 10:00pm (it actually only stop at 10:30pm).My friends (two ladies from the Ukraine) had the same problem with accessing the door to the rooms and when they got their card authorized, they found a man dressed only in shorts inside the room. The complained to the reception and the hotel sent someone to inspect the room to confirm that there was a man in the room. After confirmation, it took about 30 minutes for the Hotel to find my friends another room at a different floor. All in all it took about 1 hour for the hotel to check them in.The room is clean and as per advertised.What is Good?The Hotel is in the middle of the tourist street and close to shopping centers and food and pubs. It has a lounge with a band (obviously since it was blasting free loud music to my room until 10.30pm whether I like it or not). We were using the meeting room for our event and the facilities were good. The food served for lunch and coffee breaks were good.What is NOT good?The Service from this hotel is very poor and the staff is not organized. The reception is not pro-active or helpful. The hotel is about 1.2 km from the Kuta Beach and shopping area. This is an OK Hotel where the rooms are clean and location is on the Tourist street of Bali. This hotel will not be my first choice to recommend based on our experience. There are better hotels for the same price.\n",

      "  review_body : Very close to Ngurah Rai airport in Denpasar and I would recommend just getting a taxi from the airport to Kuta rather than pre book a shuttle, you can also haggle the price of the taxi.Kuta is known for partying and drinking but this hotel is away from all that but still only a short walk into town. The hotel had a nice small pool area and the rooms were very nice. The only thing we weren't happy with was the wifi had a very poor connection everywhere in the hotel and the security guard helped a taxi rip us off with prices knowing we were first time visitors to Bali. Apart from that, no complaints.This hotel is a short flat walk to the mall, the water park and the beach. The breakfast is also very nice and it's a buffet style.I recommend this hotel if you are visiting Kuta but not to party as there are many more hotels closer to the party strip. We stayed here to visit the water park and the beach.Thank you for a lovely stay. \n",

One of our rooms had a a/c problem and they fixed it promptly. Close to the beach and lots of touristy services close by. Wide variety of food available within walking distance. Even Indian vegetarian! The many 24hr convenience stores in the vicinity were a great plus. Given the traffic in Bali, closeness to the airport is a huge convenience. The tour desk was great. They kept us busy for 3 days at a very affordable price. A comment about Bali, not the hotel: be ready to pay or everything. Tourist attractions, toilets, water, etc. all charge a small price. I thought the prices were fair. But some in my party thought it went a bit too far. \n",

Rooms are tired and housekeeping is not up to scratch - we had to constantly ask for fresh towels for our toddler and for new sheets. Smokers everywhere, from corridors to check-in lobby to public areas to poolside to restaurant. Disgusting. For some reason our rooms kept locking us out, electricity was disconnected and air conditioning had to be fixed twice. The front office staff were rude when we asked for two of our rooms to be moved closer and the night auditor/manager was kind enough to have a chat with us. Still our request was not considered during the 10 nights we had booked. Staff did not seem to enjoy their work and had hung gloomy faces floating around. Very obvious that little was being to support training. Steer clear off this motel.\n",

Also they didn't have change so I had to pay more. Airco made a lot of noise.The hotel driver tried to make me pay 300k to go to semniyak. It was only 50k with Uber. I got it down to 100k but this is UNACCEPTIBLE. As a tourist you do not want to get scammed and you would think the hotel driver would be honest with you. The rooms that are overlooking the pool will wake up around 7 because of yelling children. That was also not very relaxing start of my day and vacation. Big bed was 2 beds pushed together and ended up hurting my back a lot. Other then that the location is okay it's close to the airport. The hotel is very pretty and the rooms are too. But these things could have made my stay better. \n",

The only problem was the traffic - very busy at night and took a long time to get to hotel after a day's outing.Toilet with a glass door preventing water all over the floor. Free WiFi with reasonable speed.They would not give me another room card - for no reason, which makes it very inconvenient if you and your partner/room mate want to do things separately. You cannot get to your floor without the room card.Large area for breakfast, with both western and local Indonesian food. However, one morning, we were a little late, around 8:00am and it was packed.\n",

It is also close to the restaurants and shops at Kuta area (centre of Bali) and close to Lippo Mall and Saint Francis Xavier Catholic Church. It is also 10 minutes walk to Discovery Mall and some other souvenir shops at the area. The hotel staffs were very helpful! Even the security staffs helped us carried our things back to our room. The hotel staffs were very warm and friendly and always put on a smile. The facilities are good like the swimming pool. We stayed at the room by the pool. Just open your back door take a dip at the pool. The food is good. I would definitely come back and stay at this hotel. The manager also have arranged our transport to the airport. Thank you to Pak Made. Cheers! \n",

Lucky me, the hotel provide conecting room and all rooms are pool access.Check in was slow and reception look confuse and not skillfull. He always asking his friend beside him for every progress and even transaction. Less eyes contact.It was wrong to choose rooms with pool access since the water get in to the rooms. Especially some guest swimming fastly and then the water coming in to the room. It happen again and again. The reception is helpfull when I did complaint. I dislike when some other guests playing and jumping in the pool and made a flood to my rooms. Pool access room is really not recommended. The rest, breakfast is average. Lunch and dinner during Nyepi is so so and we prefer room service.Thanks.\n",

We enjoyed our first Indonesian lunch and dinner in the restaurant. On-site massage was good. Pool area is very nice and relaxing. Located about 10 minutes from the airport and walking distance to shopping, malls and other restaurants.

The other issue we had personally the bed were a little hard, but managed to get a good night sleep. There was that typical a musty and hydrogen sulphide smell in the room, but that’s common in Indonesian hotels and apartments but dissipates quickly after aeration and use of shower ect.I would highly recommend the Hotel that offers great value for money, location and welcoming attentive staff.\n",

(This was reflected everywhere in kuta not just here) the staff were all excellent, some reviews had said they were rude, we did not experience this at all, everyone was lovely, helpful and polite. Ngurah was lovely thought our stay and very chirpy :-) The room was nice, cleaned daily and we had bottled water refreshed every day. The location is great, 2 mins walk from lippo mall, plenty of places to eat and have a massage nearby, also a couple of handy supermarkets either side. It's about a 15min walk to discovery mall, if you walk through the mall it opens right on the beach which is a lot closer than the actual beach entrance! All in all, a lovely place to stay. \n",

      "  review_body : we booked a transfer with the hotel for when we arrived. When we arrived at the airport we went to the service desk so the lady could announce over the attenoy that we had arrived, the lady announced it again 5 minutes later and still nothing. we waited 15 minutes and my hubby walked around the other side of the airport and outside to see if we could see our transfer, as we couldn't find our transfer we caught a taxi. When we arrived at the resort we advised the gentleman at the concierge desk that we had booked a transfer but it did not arrive, he basically turned around and said well she is there and she has been waiting 30 mins. Sorry but we checked she wasnt there or was not visable to people who had just come off a plane, a tranfer is supposed to be visible to its passengers!we were advised we were upgraded to another room as all the rooms with king beds were taken, we were quite happy about this but presumed the room would be on the ground floor as we had specified in our booking through agoda ( we requested this due to having a 2.5 year old and needing the use of a pram to get around the resort and outings), we were placed on the 3rd floor and we decided at the time we would have a quick look in the room and see if it was ok if not go back to reception. by the time we got to our room our toddler was over tired and cranky and it just wasnt worth the hassle, the room itself on first impressions was quite nice so we left it.When it came to using the toilet my husband advised me that the bathroom is in no way the same presentation as the bedroom, not understanding him i went to look. There was mold all around the base and corners of the grout in the shower that looks like it happens because the cleaners dont clean the showers properly each day. This was very off putting and  the next day we went to carrefour and i got some antibacterial wipes and gave it a good once over  just incase it hadnt been properly cleaned before our arrival. Also the tiles behind the door and in the shower were cracked (this was something we had to be extremelt careful of with our two year old, ensuring she didnt hurt herself).The daily cleaning service was average. Yes you got your two bottles of water and your room was cleaned daily but upon watching them clean briefly before going down to the pool they get a spray bottle and spray the bed and the  make it, they dont replace the sheets. Bathroom towels are replaced daily. Toilet roll i was disappointed with this you get once roll a day no spare, so if the roll you have is half or more full they dont leave a spare ( for three people this is not enough the should always be one full roll as a spare in the room and the current roll), i had to ask twice for toilet roll in the end it was a tad embarassing so i took an extra one of the cleaning cart when it was near my room.The staff i cannot speak highly enough of they are all polite and make you feel welcome, say hello but the english with some of the workers could be better. ( i.e, one day we went to breakfast and there was no where to sit, one of the workers asked a patron if they would mind if we sat with them without asking us prior, usually i wouldn't  mind however our two year old was not exactly quiet during meal times and i didnt want to offend other patrons so i asked if we could sit upstairs and the worker tried to say but food has to stay down stairs,  after bei ng quite firm  and insiting we go upstairs we were alloud. I then tried my best to explain to the worker about our daughter not being quiet and wanting other patrons to enjoy there breakfast in peace, he then understood.The breakfast was quite tasty, lots of variety. The only thing i would add is instead of waffles daily could they alternate with pancakes. All in all the breakfast was delicious.Out of the four days we had breakfast here  we tried to come down at different times to avoid being to busy  but it just wasnt possible, we were able to find tables some days but had to ask the workers to clear the tables first as they hadnt had chance to get to them. I would suggest given the over flow outside the restaurant has tiny tables  that either the workers advised patrons where to sit or they open the over flow upstairs to patrons.One morning when we woke up we had a problem with our safe not opening. All funds for the day were in the safe and we were due to leave the resort at 9am to travel to the zoo. We were told that the manager would have to come and open the safe and she wouldnt be in until 9am. I made it clear we had no funds and needed to leave at 9am so to come to the room asap. I really valued that fact that 10 minutes later we recieved a phone call from the front desk advising they were sending someone up to fix the safe. The manager did not attend to the room but i was extremely grateful that they understood the priority of opening our safe.I would love to give it a 5 star review as it has the potential but its just not there yet, there were a few thing that let it down such as above. Would i stay here again? no but a big bonus is how close it is to the airport about 10mins max. If i was staying in kuta over night as a layover to fly somewherte else though i would definetly stay here.Although the resort allows children, and the staff really make you feel welcome the design of the resort is not make for familys with young children. I.e sofa bed in room was next to the window. Because the resort is built around the pool, sound in the pool echos, if you want peace and quiet avoid a room directly next to the pool.Really enjoyed our stay at the hotel would just like to see the rooms maintained better. BUT the air con was awesome, it was very cold the whole time and i really valued this.\n",

Location is also great, not as noisy as Legian road, a bit far from Kuta beach but u can go to the beach through the parking of Discovery Mall or the Mall itself. Lippo Mall is 2 minute walk from the hotel and we really loved it's food court called \"Hungry Pirates\" as we grabbed lunch there before our flight. The hotel is 10 minutes away from the Ngurah Rai airport by car. The air conditioner takes time to cool up but works fine.\n",

      "  review_body : We booked for two nights and stayed for three. The location was good for us - walking distance to Waterbom, and shops/restaurants. This is the first hotel on our Bali stay - we wanted something nice to start our holiday and to get through the jet-lag. The bed was super comfortable and bathroom was good (could use a little bit of a scrub in the shower to remove mildew though). The towels need to be replaced - they were worn down and grey looking - still clean - they just need newer ones. We didn't have breakfast included, but we purchased it anyway. With mostly asian options, I loved it! I hate american breakfast (eggs, bacon etc) so the breakfast selection for me was great! They still do omelettes and waffles and croissants etc, but I stuck with the gato gato and hot \"dinner type\" options. The pool ares is nice, but because the hotel is several stories high and surrounds the pool, it wasn't very sunny for long - not really an issue at all. The lobby was always busy and packed with tour groups, but not an issue really. Staff were all super nice - especially the guards out front. Would book again.\n",

      "  review_body : Last time I visited this hotel, it still had a different name and probably owner. I also remembered it to be clean etc, but this time, the showers definitely didn't feel clean to me, especially the showerhead. The rooms feel a tad old and some sheets had some spots on them. Definitely not why I came back and I doubt if I will come back again. However, the location of the hotel is really convenient and near 2 malls and the beach, plus the staff is really nice. The first night, our airconditioning didn't work and was leaking. There also was a really bad smell, as if someone was smoking cigarettes. After asking about it at the counter, they immediately send someone (it was 01.00) to repair it, mop the water and to do something about the smell. The airco worked after that but the next night, the cigarette smell was back again, making me wonder if it was actually from the air conditioning or our neighbours smoking. Nonetheless, they had no problem arranging a new room for us, so very friendly staff, but the rooms...\n",

The thing that you guys need to get better is your breakfast... the bread is terrible.. artificial jam..(too much chemical) no choice on drinks and service is too slow. Lunch and Dinner is amazing tho, the food is also delicious.. just so different 360 degrees when we talk about breakfast. Hope you guys make things better, cuz we love the hotel and also the staff. \n",

      "  review_body : I booked a room for myself and the room was really clean even though it was a bit small. I really liked the pool that was just outside of my room. Staff were nice and friendly. It was a bit far from Kuta beach. It took me like 20 mins to get to the beach. You can take a taxi if you don't want to walk to the beach. One problem was that someone called my room during my stay. This person knew my room number, said he loves me and made weird noise over the phone. I was really scared as i was alone in the room. So i hung up the phone. That guy called me again in 10 mins and said the same things. I said i'll call the police if he keeps doing it then he said sorry and hang up the phone. I called the reception directly and asked if anyone called my room. They said nobody called my room and didn't know what was going on. So i couldn't figure out anything who called / what happened. This was the only problem during my stay! So please be aware when you stay here.혼자서 여행을 갔을 때 묵었는데 저렴한 가격과 깨끗한 방으로 꽤 만족을 했습니다. 특히나 방 앞에 있던 수영장도 좋았고, 다만 아쉬운점은 쿠타 비치와 거리가 조금 멀었다는 것 입니다. 직원들도 친절했고, 요청하면 택시도 금방 잡아주었습니다. 제가 혼자서 묵을때 밤에 방으로 전화가 걸려와서 한 남자가 이상한 소리를 내며 사랑한다고 말하고 제 방 번호를 안다고 했습니다 .너무 무서워서 전화를 끊으니 한 10분뒤 다시 전화가 왔고 어디서 왔냐며 물었습니다. 그래서 한번만 더 전화하면 경찰에 전화하겠다고 하니 다시 전화가 오지 않았습니다 .리셉션에 전화해서 혹시 누가 내 방으로 전화했냐고 하니 모른다고 했습니다. 혼자서 여행중이여서 약간 무서웠지만, 다시 전화가 오지 않아서 다행이기도 했습니다. 혼자서 여행하시는 여자분들은 항상 조심하세요.\n",

Check in staff attended to my needs immediately on arrival, I was given a tasty juice and cool facial towel to freshen up with as I registered with the resort.The hotel grounds are well maintained and clean with a centrally located pool, All rooms have a view of the swimming area. There are two bars, one pool side the other as a part of the hotel's restaurant, located at the entrance.My room was of a comfortable size with two single beds and a spacious bathroom. Included in the room was an air conditioner, a study desk with lamp, hotel information brochures and telephone. A flat screen TV with cable channels, tea and coffee facilities a small safe and bar fridge. Two bottles of mineral water were included in the price of the room daily. The bathroom was modern with a great hot water system, bathtub, shower and toilet with basic amenities.The location is a plus, close to the airport ( No longer than 10 minutes by taxi) yet walking distance to shopping malls, places to eat and entertainment. Staff were exceptional and overall the hotel is very reasonably priced. Breakfast was available (Buffet from what I saw) but my hotel package didn't include it. I give this property the thumbs up and highly recommend it to all travellers.\n",

      "  review_body : We stayed at the Grand Ixora for 3 days after arriving in Bali and before heading to Lembongan. We have been to Bali numerous times and the Grand Ixora served its purpose of being close to all the facilities such as Waterbom, Discovery, Lippo and Kuta Square.The facility is a little on the tired side even though it is fairly new. The staff were all really friendly and the service was great.The breakfast was nothing special and quite limited for Bali standards.The pool was clean and wet but the seating was limited and in the sun most of the day.I would recommend the Grand Ixora to anyone who was looking for that short stay of a few days where you wanted to be close to the shopping or airport when just arriving or leaving Bali. \n",

Clean room , friendly staf , premium location in the center of kuta, 5 minute from airport , walking distance to Lippo Mall, 5 minute to Water Boom, 5 minute to Centro beach front mall, in the main street and hustle bustle of Kuta wide selection restaurants.

      "  review_body : This hotel is close to the airport, which makes it ideal for layovers. The price is very affordable. It is a few minutes walk away from two malls, and some restaurants. Although the beds were hard, the rooms were clean and functional. Breakfast starts at 7:00 am and it was hard to find a place to sit. Staff was friendly, and the pool area was very clean. There is someone on the front desk 24/7 for those who need late a check in or an early check out. Overall a clean hotel we will use again for layovers in Bali.\n",

      "  review_body : I stayed in this hotel in July 2015 for 3 nights. I can't praise it enough!! It was so cheap, staff were wonderful, room was very cosy with a comfy bed. Pool area was so calm and peaceful with a bar right beside it for food and drinks which were always available. It is approx 15 mins from the airport. The only bad thing about this hotel was that it's about 10 mins from the main beach walk area but that's not a whole lot to complain about really!! \n",

      "  review_body : This hotel is great value for money, right in the center of Kuta and not far from the beach at all just a 5 minute walk. Two big shopping malls are within 5 minute walk as well and local shops selling all the stuff you expect in Asia are everywhere around.The hotel is a bit away from the street and therefore there is no street noise. I had a room with pool view which gave it a very lovely touch to open your curtains and look at a stunning pool setting, white building and beautiful green palm trees.The staff is very lovely and helpful and taught me some local language. I had to wait until 2pm to get in to my room, but the room was very nice so I could not complain.The WiFi is a thing, it is ok. It is not bad at all, though sometimes it seems like its busy on the line and is a bit slow, but mostly the speed was good. Though you constantly have to check back in again. That is not a problem if it is 3x a day, but if it is like 20x a day it gets annoying.The rooms are nice, very well maintained and feels like a really proper hotel room. There are a lot of toiletries provided and a safety box and a fridge. There is a little desk and a chair and a charming bed. Laundry service is available but is per pieces and not per KG, so freaking expensive! Unfortunately the walls are thin and you can hear a lot of what the neighbour say, but I was lucky as my neighbours were sleeping at 22h.\n",

The wifi was good until 6.30-7PM lol. A feedback for the hotel management: we booked the Hotel via Booking.com and left a comment that we requested a terrace room just in front of the pool but when wr arrived, the room was not available. The hotel management said they will provide it. In the future, it would be better if the hotel contact the traveller (via email etc) when the requested room was not available on the arrival date.Regards,Putri\n",

Superior room is small but efficient, they keep it clean. Quite spacious compared to some other buget hotel in kuta area thou. And due to its location in the corner of an alley, so every room has a view and got sunlight.Cant review the breakfast since we decided not to choose with it. Convenience store and foodstall are everywhere, and lippomall is only a hundred metres away.If you looking for the beach, nearest beach is pantai kuta jerman, about 800m. Less crowded than the famous kuta beach.\n",

They provide rooms with two bottles of water each day and they even put thought into little details such as arranging my makeup on my dresser for me. They even slipped us a reminder note under the door when we didnt arrange for roomkeeping, to let us know they will bring us towels if needed. Honestly I wasnt expecting half as much for the price. Room service is also surprisingly good, and its even 24/7 . Wifi was speedy enough and the spa was great! The poor though small is well kept and peaceful. This is our new favourite hotel in Kuta for sure. Its a bit further down from Kuta square, about a 10 min walk, but it right next to Discovery mall. Which we actually prefer. HIGHLY RECOMMEND\n",

      "  review_body : Normally I love to post positive reviews and there are some good points about this place.... Yes it is in Kuta but about 30 minute walk from the action.The rooms are tiny and cramped and the wifi is slow and at night nonexistent.$128 per night is expensive and we expected more than a room that fits in two single beds and about half a meter around it.... Yep it's that small.My big issue is the rip off....We brought the full board which was Breakfast Lunch and Dinner Breakfast is included in every hotel in Bali .... We were told we had 100,000 to spend each meal... So first night we ordered Nasi Georing and it was 70,000 the bill came to 120000 we asked why and they said the full board cost is higher, we asked why it is the same meal as if we brought on the menu our meal had no extra, the waiter and manager said, they is just the way it is.... All meals are double just about the menu price if you pre order. The rooms are all facing the pool and during the day in this family hotel the staff (at times it was just them) play doff doff music so loud that you cannot even hear your TV in your room and the room vibrates.It does not live up to they price at all..........The beds are comfortable and the food is nice as is the service\n",

The breakfast was a bit limited on western food, but just ask the staff and they are more than happy to get you some western food from the kitchen.. The rooms are great, pool is always clean and staff are always happy. 3 min walk to Lippo Mall and 8 mins walk to Discovery Mall ... All in All and great little gem.. So great that 8 of our wedding guests have already booked to go back here and stay...\n",

Our room was a 2 single bed into into one queen size which we found it kinda uncomfortable but after that we just ignored the combined middle part lol. Aircon was not that cold but it was somehow just the right temperature for us. Balcony wise facing the pool was a nice view! was very useful too as we can hang our wet clothes. Overall. Good stay nearby the malls and yes good job to the team. Friendly and reliable hotel.;)\n",

      "  review_body : The location is perfect. Near the airport and by walking distance you can get to the malls and Kuta beach. While my stay in the superior room there, the bathroom comes with no exhaust fan. It bothered me a big time. There was sometime that the electricity was off for some reason, but it worked fine within 1min without me doing anything. No idea what's wrong with it. And by the way, the hair dryer is upon request but no additional cost. However, I would expect it as a standard in the room. I like the breakfast especially the freshly made fried eggs or omelette and coffee. Overall I am satisfied with the hotel with its fair cost. \n",

      "  review_body : I was quite impressed when I arrived at the hotel... until I saw my room. It was stuck on the end and was it really dark, no natural light even when you are sitting outside because its the only outside area that is covered. In the room with the curtains closed, you feel like you are in a cave, however if you open the curtains, instead of the lovely pool view which every other room has, you have the public walkway heading towards you so everyone that walks down there is looking directly into your room the whole way. And sitting out the front you have staff with trolleys and other guests walking next to you every 5 minutes. I asked for the room next to the pool like I had booked but was told they were booked out. I went to buy some drinks for the bar fridge as we are celebrating a special occasion and of course the fridge doesn't work.. I asked 3 staff and finally someone came and replaced it which is a good start. It would have been better if I'd been given a different room but I've already paid for 2 nights and they won't give me a different one, there were other similar options for hotels and I wish I had of chosen one of them.\n",

It's very close to airport, maybe 10 mins drive. My booking include airport pickup and we see the driver when we just step out of the waiting area in airport. The room is average. Size is ok. Bed is ok. average clean. The water of Shower is bit small and cold. Breakfest is ok, no much choice.Overall, it's a good choice with its cost (about $45 net per night).\n",

      "  review_body : I'm just going to be very factual with this hotel as it is very standard. Pros- great breakfast, nice hotel design and modern bathrooms. Cons- hard bed (in my opinion that is a con) we didn't get a double bed- 2 single beds pusses together and they couldn't even put a double quilt on top, they kept it as 2 single quilts on it. The room we were in was one of the darkest rooms in the history of rooms and the showers weren't the best. Also and this is very important- the airport is SO close. Seriously it's 2km away- it took us 10 minutes on foot with backpacks on. Please don't get the 150,000Rp shuttle that they provide. This is a ridiculous amount for the distance. If you have to get a taxi then pay no more than 50,000- this will still be too much for the distance but they won't budge on that. \n",

Toast and cereal, juice, milk , tea and coffee and also some Indonesian foods too, fairs, fair.Close enough to all the shopping centres, markets, spas and cocos express super market. The hotel staff are all so friendly, we had to stay 10 days extra for the volcanic ash cloud prevented us getting home, but we were safe and relaxing in a very nice hotel, the staff accommodated us every time we had to re schedule our flights which was 4 times.We would especially like to thank \"Febi\" she was just the best always smiling and very understanding on getting us a new room every time, because we actually checked out and went to the airport and had to come back as the flights were cancelled once we got to the boarding gates. Oh well\".This hotel is mainly for overnighters. As its close to the airport. We ended up staying for three weeks. It was perfect....... The pools not overly big but enough to get wet in and cool down. Definitely not for kids..We are planning another trip to Bali in June 2016 there are 15 of us at this stage and we are definitely booking this hotel. We loved it and would definitely recommend it. That's why we're bring a big group of us back.Wifi worked on the 2nd floor or lower, we know cause we had three different rooms. Lol....Air con was good in all rooms, no problems the whole time we were there...Hope this helps with your decisions in finding a hotel. I could keep going but there's not much room left haha..Gosh, Richard C that rated this place poor needs his head examined, obviously expects way too much for so little..enjoy Bali it's such a beautiful place.\n",

Definitely not for kids..We are planning another trip to Bali in June 2016 there are 15 of us at this stage and we are definitely booking this hotel. We loved it and would definitely recommend it. That's why we're bring a big group of us back.Wifi worked on the 2nd floor or lower, we know cause we had three different rooms. Lol....Air con was good in all rooms, no problems the whole time we were there...Hope this helps with your decisions in finding a hotel. I could keep going but there's not much room left haha..Gosh, Richard C that rated this place poor needs his head examined, obviously expects way too much for so little..enjoy Bali it's such a beautiful place.\n",

      "  review_body : It is actually our nth time to visit Bali and we always choose to stay at the Grand Ixora. Our reasons are simple:1. Reasonable rates at approximately US $50 a night booked thru Agoda2. Great location of the hotel. It is in the fringes of Kuta meaning the quieter, more relaxed side but right across is the new Lippo Mall and within walking distance are the Discovery Mall, the Kuta Beachwalk, and numerous bars, restaurants, and shops.3. Cleanliness of the entire hotel property: from the entrance, the all day dining restaurant, the pool area, and the rooms!4. Lastly and most importantly is the WARMTH and EFFICIENCY of the staff. MISS UCIK and her supervisor, MISS SINTHA graciously welcomed us and granted our request for a room beside the swimming pool. They likewise answered all of our queries with knowledge and a smile! MR NGURAH JACK of the food and beverage department was always on hand and present to attend to our needs when we were hungry or thirsty! When we shared with MR NGURAH JACK that our wifi signal in the room was weak, he immediately informed the technical staff. Right away they installed a wifi router in our room! And in less than 5 minutes, MR TU WIRA of engineering department also fixed our toilet sink which had a minor problem!No doubt, Grand Ixora will always be our hotel of choice in Bali!\n",

      "  review_body : We had been staying at the Grand Ixora for a week and the day my mother and I were due to checkout was the day the volcanic ash closed the airport. The staff could not have been more friendly or helpful with our extended stay. The service we were given by duty manager Sintha and all the staff at reception was amazing and Ngurah the bell captain went above and beyond to help us. The hotel itself is smaller and more personal which we loved. A smple buffet breakfast which was included in our room rate was more than enough for us each morning. This may not be a big resort hotel like many in Bali, but it certainly is value for money. It's a 2 minute walk to Lippo Mall, 5 minutes to Discovery Mall and Waterbom Park and many restaurants, so you couldn't get a better location. The only negative comment I have was with the wifi, but we were on the top floor and from speaking to others it was good on lower floors but it wasn't a big problem. There are 3 computers that guests can use in the lobby.\n",

      "  review_body : Maybe I'm a little spoilt by the great service I've experienced at the many lovely hotels I've stayed, but this hotel is just not good enough.The room was small. Most of the space was taken up by the King-sized bed. The open wardrobe was very narrow with only 4 hangers; the counter which doubles as a writing desk was narrow with barely enough room for cameras, mobile phones, tablets, etc; there were no drawers or shelves for clothes and shopping. There was simply no space to use a notebook computer. The bathroom was cramped - you need to twist your way around the door to get into the shower cubicle.The window looks out onto the roof tiles of an adjourning building. And the TV was just a little bigger than my desktop monitor. To be fair, there was a wide selection of TV channels, but then who goes to Bali to watch TV in their hotel room?Coffee and tea making facilities were available, but coffee and tea bags are not included - there were none when I checked in, and it was never replenished over 3 days.The buffet breakfast looked more like leftovers by 9:30 am, although breakfast is served till 10:30 am. The egg and waffle stations were unmanned; when asked, the staff agreed to make an omelette, but said \"no\" to waffles. I ate breakfast out the next 2 mornings.The lift required a room access card to go up, but why bother when there is an open staircase right next to the lift. After all, the hotel only has 5 floors.When my room access card could not unlock my room door, the staff at the reception rectified the problem immediately, without checking my identity. How convenient if I wanted to break into another room...Stayed during an incentive trip organized by company.\n",

This hotel is on the outskirts of the hustle and bustle of Kuta, so it's close enough to walk to most places but far enough that there isn't a lot of noise. Our shower didn't have very good flow (slow and spitting water at different angles where it wasn't blocked) and that can be annoying, we only stayed one night though so we dealt with it.\n",

      "  review_body : My Experience at Grand Ixora Kuta Resort was fantastic, I met a young man called Ngurah/ known as Jack. His service was excellent we became friends who would of thought. He was very help full and he is one of the supervisors at Grand Ixora Resort Kuta. I think he should be promoted to manager when I next visit. The service was very friendly all the time when he would greet myself and not only myself I, had seen him go above and beyond with others that were staying at the resort as well so for anyone staying there would of felt very welcomed. His leadership was observed by myself as he directed his staff that were under him excellently. I got the big impression that they followed him because he had a sense of leadership that his fellow colleges thought was going to rub off.Thanks Jack/Ngurah for been a cool guy, Agus (Bar Tender he was the one with the mussels) was also excellent and I think he learnt some skills of Ngurah/Jack. Thanks so much for making me feel welcome in Bali for my first time Jack & Agus.\n",

      "  review_body : We loved this hotel. We took a promotion, and it turned out to be great value for money. Not all the rooms are the same, however, I asked upon booking to have a room with a balcony on the upper floor as I am afraid to stay on the ground floor, and I got what I asked for - great communication with the hotel, they responded very quickly to my email. The room was big and spacious, my only remark - towels seem a little old, but otherwise the cleaning service was excellent (we left the room for 40 min to go to the pool, when we were back - it was clean), bed is big and comfortable, computers are available in the lobby, and the swimming pool is great. It's a pity they close it at 9PM, could have worked for 1 or 2 hours longer (it's especially nice in the evening). Clean towels are provided to use at the swimming pool. The TV in the room has a lot of foreign channels. We also used spa and that was nice as well. Staff is very kind and friendly, ready to meet any demand, always smiling. Special thanks to the great receptionist named Leni, she's a great worker and very kind with guests. A point of improvement - wifi does not work very well, when there's a lot of people on it. When I come back to Kuta, I will definitely consider staying here again. \n",

      "  review_body : Booked a superior room for 3 nights, on arrival at 1am reception staff insisted on cash payment. We explained we had just got off a flight and if required we would obtain Indo. rupiah next day. Also advised them we booked with our visa card, but he insisted on cash and demanded our passport as security! Reluctantly we handed it over and asked that it be placed in the safe as security. (next day we got it back, not from a safe but simply thrown into a drawer at reception!) In their advertising online our room was shown as having a balcony and two chairs with an outlook. The room we got was small, at the rear of the building and bore no resemblance to the photo shown on their website.YOU DONT GET WHAT THEY SHOW YOU ONLINE! we inquired about the difference but were told that the room we had was correct.End of story! Breakfast was ordinary, eggs, toast, some melon, that was about it for western tastes . Unfortunately I used my birth date as the security code for the room safe, after checking out and flying to our new destination we found half our holiday cash had gone missing, I cannot say with certainty that something happened at the hotel, but fellow travelers should be very very wary of handing over a passport to hotel staff .\n",

      "  review_body : We experienced an unfortunate stay at a hotel within walking distance to the Grand Ixora. After 3 days we decided to check out and look for another hotel. The Grand Ixora was the second hotel we visited and asked for connecting rooms accommodation. After explaining our situation they were very obliging. Showed us the rooms before we made a decision. The rooms were clean, bright, inviting and comfortable. We received a great deal of $55 per night per room and breakfast was included. Hotel even picked us up at the other hotel to help us move in.Great location. Less than 5 minute walk to Lippo Mall, Commonwealth Bank, Carla's Spa. Ten minute walk the other way to Discovery Mall and most of the restaurants. Close to airport. Pool and bar facilities were good. Friendly staff, who are polite and nothing was too much trouble to attend to for us. Although hotel was on Kartika Plaza and our rooms were at the front of the hotel, we were not bothered by traffic noises. Wifi was not great but it wasn't that great anywhere we went around Kuta that offered free wifi.Would definitely stay there again.\n",

      "  review_body : This hotel is in an ideal place to stay while you are in Bali located in jalen Kartika just 5 minute walk to the Discovery Plaza and just across the road from the new wonderful Lippo mall. While the hotel is on a busy road it has no effect in room noise. the rooms are spacious, clean and the linen is good. We have stayed twice at the hotel and have never had a problem. The WiFi is ok as well. We found the staff to be courteous at all times and nothing was to much trouble for them. Breakfast is full on and nothing is left to the imagination.As we drive our own vehicle parking was safe and secure at all times.The hotel is a non smoking hotel ( but a room with a balcony smoking is permitted)\n",

Shuttle to the airport is included in the price of the room [for us anyway].The room while not big was clean with comfortable beds and nice towels. There wasn't a lot of hot water in the shower,but there may have been a problem and it was very hot so a cool shower was welcome. Staff need to ensure the showers are cleaned as there is mold between the lower tiles.There is a mall across the road with shopping and eating areas.The staff were very polite and obliging and nothing was to much trouble.One of the best things is;it is a completely smoke free hotel ..

      "  review_body : My husband and I have just finished a 5 night stay at Grand Ixora and we thought this was a nice hotel. It's very clean and well presented, with a lovely pool area. We had a superior room on the first floor overlooking the pool so I was a little worried about potential noise but the room was actually very quiet. All the staff we met at the hotel were extremely polite and helpful, and always with a great big smile. There was a small hiccup on our first night here when the Perspex light fitting above our bed fell out of place and onto our heads just as we were going to sleep, but my husband was able to fix it and it didn't bother us again! The breakfast in the hotel was also very good, with a lot of choice between sweet, savoury and Asian foods. There was also an egg station with someone cooking to your personal taste.As for location, the hotel is somewhat on the edge of the main strip of restaurants in Kuta, which was fine for us as we enjoyed the walk to and from dinner, but something to bear in mind if you are not a walker and are looking for somewhere more centrally located. It's still not massively out of the way by any means.All in all we had a very pleasant stay at Grand Ixora. If you want clean, modern accommodation in a good location then it is definitely one to consider! \n",

A good budget option for a short stay.\n",

The rooms are beautiful and the cable tv is an extra bonus! Swimming pool is very nice but unfortunately it does not get any sun!! It is always completely shaded. The wifi is not very strong in the rooms but I regularly used the computers in the reception which was very helpful. I paid for the breakfast for the first 2 days but to be honest, it was not very good. I would reccommend you go elsewhere for breakfast. Location is right on the main Kuta strip. Not noisy at all. Highly recommend.\n",

      "  review_body : My favorite part of this hotel is that it was located nearby Ngurah Rai International Airport! It takes about 5-10 min to reach the airport if the traffic is smooth but around 30min max if the traffic were heavy! Nearby Grand Ixora hotel there's a lot of cafe / restaurant / shops. Lippo mall was about 3-5 min away and discovery mall was like 10 min away for walking distance.The lobby area was very welcoming. Polite , welcoming , friendly staffs too. No worries cause they can speak English or Bahasa Melayu. So there's no problem in communication. They had got reasonable average wifi speed. And a tips here , this hotel do provide hairdryer but upon request! While for the room size,it was quite ok up to my own preferences but the toilet was quite small in size but still okay. Clean white bedsheets provided and both the small fridge and aircon was functioning well. The only thing that disappoints me was the hygiene of the toilet. I do spot some small blood stains on the towel provided and also on the toilet bowl. But if we neglect this part , overall it's still a clean place to sleep. While for the TV channel , they provided a large varieties of channel , from Asian shows to western shows. Great! Overall , it was a pleasant stay! If I were to visit Bali again I will definitely comeback to Grand Ixora as the transportation was really convenient. And of course the very cozy and welcoming environment. Thank You :) \n",

Lot's of mirror decoration but already rusted from inside - look ugly and showing dirty image. Noisy air conditioning even when you set it at lowest fan. The rest of equipment, amenities were standard.Parking space almost not available and unbelievable condition. Staff could be more attentive and help full. But at the end if you stroll down the street a bit further to the right or to the left, there's a lot options available. I think this hotel really save by it's location.\n",

      "  review_body : I didn't stay at the property so I can't say much of it. However I had lunch once here and it was a nice experience.Hotel's restaurant is located at the front of the hotel with very comfortable seating arrangement. If you happen to stop by to dine in the evening, you will notice that the hotel expands the restaurant seating to the terrace, a good option if you want to dine in the open air.I ordered Chicken Kungpao. It was delicious and the portion is quite big. The highlight was the drink--Creamy Kiwi which was to die for. Just like a regular smoothie but the taste was absolutely delicious, creamy and yummy! A perfect drink and I just love it. I really recommend it to anyone dining in the restaurant or visiting this hotel.The service was okay. Good hospitality from the staff. Free Wifi is available with reasonable speed at the restaurant (and perhaps the other areas as well).Overall, it was a nice experience. I will definitely come back to have another round of Creamy Kiwi.\n",

      "  review_body : I was spend 2 night for business. Arrived in Friday night at 10 PM and there was 2 receptionist. 1 busy with other guest and the other busy with her computer. And I have to wait. I think the person in reception desk should understand that guest who check in at night need to be serve quickly. Checking process only 10 mint. I was given room 3016. Nice room, not large but it's OK for my single business. I have balcony and can see the pool. The pool is nice, small but have nice decoration. The pool located in the middle between room tower. So it's covered from the sunlight.Breakfast not much variety, and taste standard not special. But the waiters are very not helpful. I have order 2 sunny side up but until I finished my breakfast it doesn't show up. And I have remain 2 times. The restaurant was in front so you can see to the busy kartika road while have breakfast and lunch.Coffee break, pastry standard. Lunch, nothing special. So the conclusion are : the hotel location is perfect, near 2 big mall in Kuta, LIPPO MALL and KARTIKA DISCOVERY MALL. And near to the airport. The room and bed are nice. For business purposed, the hotel is recommended but for family, not perfect.Thanks.\n",

They even gave a free 15 mins massage ! :-)Couple of things: It's not right on the beach but very close to discovery mall which opens to the beach. Walking distance to lots of restaurants with lots of choices. Also lots of shopping places, and tourists shops for activity bookings like daily trips, water activities. The hotel pool is very nice. Shaded no sun, but very good ambience. Rooms big and clean with lots of channels (but who stays in the room in Bali :) .Other points: very loud music at the corridors,thin walls (we always hear what's outside) and bad breakfast.Very limited choices, and nothing western.It needs to be improved drastically. Of course you can have breakfast elsewhere if you want.Other than that i would recommend if you really looking for something cheap and descent.\n",

      "  review_body : I only spent a night here, I booked here as I wanted to be close to the airport for the next day.I would have no hesitation in recommending the Grand Ixora. Check-in was quick and friendly. The foyer was modern spacious and clean. I only had a small backpack so was given the option of going to the room on my own or with a porter. The room was modern, compact and well appointed. the bed was huge (a little firm for my liking) The drapes were of a good standard and when closed, turned the room pitch black. The bathroom was also compact but shower was large and the water pressure was great.Breakfast was good - Not the best I've had but, It had everything I wanted.I think all the rooms are NO SMOKING! a very big plus for me.Pool is in the middle of the hotel, so shaded most of the time.The location is south of Waterbom (just a short walk up the road), also within walking distance to the Discovery Plaza shopping mall.I will probably book here again when I want to be close to the airport.\n",

      "  review_body : The moment we stepped on the hotel, we were welcomed by polite staff and guards. The architecture and design of the place were carefully planned and built so the ambience will be relaxing for the visitors. The resort was well-maintained because of its cleanliness. You can sense that the head of the staff carefully managed the employees. All of the staff that we talked to can speak in English. We stayed in a superior room overlooking the swimming pool. We found it cozy and comfortable. We loved the food for breakfast most especially the waffles. It is a strategic place because it is near 2 malls. (Lippo Mall and Discovery Mall) It is walking distance to the beach. 15 min away from the airport. We enjoyed using the bicycles as part of their amenities. The place is safe. There was a night that we forgot to close our door and valuables were just accessible. None of those were gone and we felt secured. Overall service was good. We would definitely come back and recommend Grand Ixora Kuta Resort to our friends and family.\n",

As we were on our honeymoon and mentioned that with our booking, we had a lovely decoration in our room. One and massive downside was the bathroom - it was very dirty and you could see it hasn't been cleaned thorougly in a while. The water didn't drain properly so you end up showering in your own filth. Water also goes everywhere on the floor from the shower.When mentioning this on check out, we were told to have addressed this at the time. As we had been flying all day, we really couldn't be bothered at 11PM as the only thing we wanted to do was sleep. Nice enough hotel but wouldn't stay again.\n",

Heaps of eating places, restaurants, cafe, souvenir shops, massage, supermarket, money changer etc. The room is not too big but clean and well decorated. The view from our room is not appealing due to building surround it. Anyway, who stay at the room in Bali. It is only 15-20 minute to Airport. Definetely will be back.\n",

They provide mini chiller, water boiler (pls note that the water from tap isn't for drinking. They do leave a note at the tap), tv, safe deposit box and hair dryer is available upon request. Overall, friendly service and we received complimentary foot massage. The masseur was very polite and pleasant lady. The only problem is that she's alone hence the availability is limited. You have to book in advance. We planned to get full body massage but that didn't happen since she's the only one there. Pool area is beautiful. I feel that the chlorine in the pool is quite strong as it leaves my skin with smell of chlorine for quite awhile. Overall I'm happy with my stay and would consider to stay here again. \n",

Room is clean and bed is comfortable, complete with amenities, mini bar & electric kettle, mini refrigerator, and safety box. I requested smoking room but hotel do not provide any, instead they gave us room with balcony facing the pool which was fantastic!! Breakfast was as if I were in 5 star hotel, served hot pancake and waffle, most important was egg, terrific for small hotel. Location is the best at Kuta area - Jl Kartika Plaza, walking distance to Discovery Mall where you get to enjoy sunset. Easy to find foods and many convenient stores.I bought the hotel voucher from Groupon Disdus, totally worth the price. Love staying here and will surely recommend to friends.\n",

      "  review_body : travelling with friends and family (8adults + 2kids + 1 infant). booked 4 rooms from booking.com with good rate (3 deluxe rooms & 1 connecting room)..FREE WIFI are available at this hotel :) ... the check in was hassle free...loved the hotel ambience..relax and calm..the rooms are clean and nice..the beds are so comfortable.. the breakfast buffet was okay..good selection of foods..the buffet starts at 7am but sometimes they are not totally ready at 7am..the pool are clean and we had great time at the pool.as usual you can order some light meal by the pool but expect some delay (my friend ordered waffle and it took about 1hr..sigh).. the location wise : near to airport and kuta (beach and shopping)...walking distance to the Discovery shopping complex..you can rent a \"sepeda\" (motorcycle) to go around..there are many shop that provide this service around this area..the nearest shop are outside of the hotel on the left hand side ..there's another shop you need to cross the road about 1-2mins walk to the left hand side..so basically, i'll recommend this hotel to anyone and definitely i'll be back to this hotel..\n",

      "  review_body : The hotel located at busy and dazzling location, 2 big malls are near by and lots of restaurants around and walking distance to 2 beaches : Segara and Kuta. We found the hotel are amazing, clean, well maintained, spacey and had lovely interior and exterior, we felt relax and great once you get in to the hotel premises . Our room facing the swimming pool at 3rd floor...we found it nice, quiet and have the romantics ambiance ( as this is our \"another\" honeymoon trips...hehehe ). Breakfast are fresh and warm and vary, but day by day almost same....need to vary the menu :) Parking for vehicle also limited....but the security always helping us to get the slot. Definitely, I strongly recommended this hotel to any travvelers : single, couple, families, and for the price : amazingly great, 4 star hotel facilities but value for money.\n",

The room is quite nice, but I saw some cracks on the wall, bathroom is clean enough, mirrors decoration make the room looked bigger. Wi fi so terrible as connection so slow. A little bit disappointed with the breakfast where the foods are not tasty as expected. The staffs were nice, security was very helpful and polite. Is it a recommended hotel to stay? Yes for short period stay.\n",

Location is great to go straight out for a beer before bed after your travels. We paid forty Australian dollars and four more for breakfast for two. I am a fussy eater but disagree with the reviews about breakfast. I would not recommend this hotel for a long stay because I love quality and comfort. However it was perfect for us on arrival. Negatives, pillows, and towels are not as you would find in a five star luxury. You get what you pay for here and we would return. Taxi to hotel was a stressful event. Bartering was essential and we still paid ten Australian dollars for a three km drive.\n",

      "  review_body : We have just returned from a 10 stay at Grand Ixora. To begin with, this hotel was awful. Dirty sheets, customer service not able to understand or speak English and the breakfast is purely Indonesian, with only corn flakes as a westerner option. The best are like concrete and the rooms smell musty. I requested a refund so we could move hotels for days but the reception pretended they did not understand, and Agoda was brilliant and offered a 50% refund as Grand Ixora weren't coming to the party.We moved rooms 3 times as the air conditioning broke in the first room, bathroom was dirty in the 2nd room and finally after complaining again, we were upgraded to junior suites, which were difficult as we were traveling with young children and has interconnecting rooms, and the Junior Suites are on separate floors. The one thing that kept us there, was the location. It's super close to central Kuta, around a 15 minute walk, and we like walking so this was very convenient to us. After moving to the junior suites, things got better. The rooms are cleaner and way more spacious and the bathrooms are large and clean. I suggest getting a junior suite. I would stay again but only in a junior suite! \n",

      "  review_body : We only manage to stay here only one night only, and to our surprise, this hotel is not bad at all.Maybe some people give this hotel 3 star, but its definitely 4 stars to us.There many things which i really luv about this hotel. First, the hotel is still look and feel like a new hotel. I don't know whether they recently renovated or what, but its definitely a good thing since everybody luv a well maintained and fresh hotel. The location of this hotel is totally wonderful, as it is located just beside Kuta main road and close to everything. From eateries to shopping complex, its is all well within reach of this hotel like 2 or 3 minutes walk from everything. Even the beach is like 4 minutes walk thru the other side of the hotel. And the beach from this hotel strip is quite ok.The room is just wonderful also as it is very minimal and I had a good sleep on the bed. They also got a nice swimming pool which is very clean, but the toilet got no pipe to be use.Another thing which is very great is the price. The price that i got for one night stay here is exactly RM100 which is around USD29!! Cant beat that price for a great, sleep quality time and well located hotel and u get everything all around.\n",

I got the room on the first floor, and balcony facing the swimming pool.. My cousins got the room facing the garden, but no balcony.. Room is clean and comfortable.. Wall between room is very thin that you can clearly hear your neighbor talking and all that.. The bathroom is clean too, but the water from the shower is a quite little..Location : Its really a very strategic location at Kuta.. Small minimart beside the hotel, and its easy to find ATM machine nearby.. Across the hotel, there's famous estaurant 'Bebek Tepi Sawah'.. Lippo mall is nearby the hotel too.. About 10 min. walk to Discovery mall, and about 15 min. walk to waterbom..Staff : For me, they lack of staff.. Checking- in and check-ing out take quite a long time.. And the receptionist is not friendly too..Spa : they only have 1 person doing spa and massage.. So only serving one person at a time, which is ridiculous..Overall this hotel is good for those who are looking for budget hotel.. it has reasonable price :) The hotel provide free wifi but its so slow..\n",

      "  review_body : The hotel changed it's name from Grand Whiz to Grand Ixora since October 2014. All taxi driver we met didn't know Grand Ixora, so we need to say Grand Whiz Kuta. Good location, less than 5 minutes walk to the new Lippomall. Discovery mall was around 10-15 minutes walk. We stayed for 1 night in Superior room. Room was quite small but it's clean. Although the hotel website said that Superior room has queen sized bed, but you can request a king size bed when you book your room. The bed was hard, can't get any good sleep here. The air conditioner wasn't well maintained, so the room was quite hot and damp.Not much choice for breakfast..standard for a 3 star hotel. There's lots of flies hanging around those food, we can't really enjoyed our breakfast here because of those flies. The hotel need to do something with those flies if they didn't want their guest to have diarrhea.\n",

      "  review_body : The staff at Grand Ixora Hotel were very friendly. I have arrived a few hours before my check in time and had no problems checking in to my small room. The room was mostly clean except a few brown stains on the curtains and blanket. The stains were small and barely noticeable. They did not smell. Later on I noticed some small ants on the bedside counter but they did not crawl on to the bed.The safety deposit box was locked by the previous guest and could not be used, however the room service provided a new safe without hesitation and even screwed it into place so that it couldn't be easily carried away. The free Wi-Fi in the hotel is unreliable and my iPhone 5s was only able to connect for no longer then 5 minutes at a time. After that I had to manually re-login through the hotels Wi-Fi user interface. The computers in the lobby were proven to be the most reliable method of accessing the World Wide Web from within The Grand Ixora.The Free Breakfast was not bad but my food standards are low and I would eat anything. They had two kinds of fresh juice, coffee, fresh egg omelets, cereal, toast and potatoes amongst a few other things.On the last day of my stay I found out that the hotel had free bicycle rental but only until 6pm which was very disappointing, because I was tiered from walking all day and really wanted to ride a bicycle instead.In general this is an alright hotel and I was mostly satisfied. The worst was the Wi-Fi. The Mojitos at the poolside bar were very pleasing. I would not recommend my friends to stay at The Grand Ixora. And if I ever visit Kuta again, I will book a more expensive hotel for a more memorable experience.\n",

Very quiet, clean, the hotel is small but thats what we liked about it. Close to everything ie, Centro, Waterbom Park and across the road is a huge hypermart.

      "  review_body : If you are reading this review, I believe that you are like me, someone who wants the best accommodation for the least price and I promise that you will unlikely be disappointed with the Grand Whiz Kuta. This boutique hotel is located merely 5 minutes away from the airport (which will likely cost you about IDR 30k or US$3 by taxi). The check-in and check-out process at the hotel is SWIFT and was done in a matter of minutes. The rooms are of reasonable size (for the price we pay) and as I took interconnecting rooms with my kids, I found the rooms to be quite spacious for a family of 5. The beds are comfy (they might be a little hard for some though) and the rain shower was fantastic! I must recommend the room service that was great! The menu was adequate and the food was delicious and cheap (a plate of nasi goreng with sate cost about IDR 50k++, about US$5). In fact, my kids love the room service so much that we have room service food for dinner almost everyday. Unlike the room service, the buffet breakfast was only average at best and the menu was designed to suit the taste of Asians (not surprising as the main clientele are Asians). The menu, though changed daily, consist of South East Asians cuisine such as dishes such as stir-fried vegetables, mee/nasi goreng, soto ayam, braised tofu, etc. For non-Asians, do not worry, you can still enjoy your usual breakfast such as cornflakes, omelets, sausages, salad, juice, etc. For spa lovers, you can get your massage therapy at the 'Jasmine spa' (located next to the pool), for a reasonable price e.g. IDR 175k for 1.5hrs traditional aromatherapy massage. Most importantly, they are safer and cleaner when compared to those along the street. For the price, I would say that the Grand Whiz Kuta is quite well located along JL Kartika. It is merely 3 mins walk to the new Lippo Mall (which has a fantastic hypermarket), 15 mins walk to the Discovery Mall, 20 mins to the Kuta Square, etc. Along JL Kartika, there are many tiny shops selling souvenirs, day trips for tourists, massage, etc, but I suggest that you avoid them as the prices are ridiculous and some of the peddlers who are non-Balinese can get quite rude if you do not buy from them. For souvenirs, I would suggest that you take a short cab ride (less than IDR 20k/US$2) to 'Krisna Oleh Oleh' (factory outlet for souvenirs), which is located near the airport. The prices here are ridiculously...CHEAP! T-shirts, slippers, miniature surf boards, essential oil, all starting from US$1 and as they are fixed price, you do not have to bargain your lung out just to save a few dollars.Although I must admit that the Grand Whiz Hotel is quite a good and cheap place to stay in Bali, there are 2 areas which I think they can improve. Firstly, the WIFI sucks! You can hardly get any signal in your rooms and if you are able to, the connection disconnect frequently which can be rather frustrating. For good WIFI signal, I would suggest that you ask for rooms overlooking the pool. The 2nd area the hotel can improve is the reliability of the power supply. During my week long stay, there were power blackout everyday! Although the power supply do resumed after a few minutes, it is terrible if you are in a shower, or worse if you are caught in the lift, which can get quite scary.Comparing with the other hotels in the vicinity, the Grand Whiz Kuta is an unpretentious boutique hotel with spa and pool facilities that provide down to earth travelers like us a cheap, comfortable and convenient accommodation for our vacation in Bali. To add, there is a ‘Bebek Tepi Sawah’ (Duck specialty) restaurant located just opposite the hotel and these free range ‘Bebek’ that grow on rice paddy fields taste real good either fried, smoked, grilled, braised, etc.\n",

      "  review_body : Pros: -1. The hotel location is very strategic, far enough from the happening area for some peace and quiet yet near enough to shopping malls, eateries and mini marts, all within walking distance, but bear in mind it's quite a long walk to the beach if you have elderly folks or little children in your traveling party.2. The room looks new and the bed is very firm, which makes for a good sleep, subject to preference of course.3. Hotel's WiFi has acceptable speed (if at all you can get a connection in your room)4. Pool is adequate and cleanCons:-1. We couldn't get a stable WiFi connection in our room which was frustrating. Although I brought this up to the management and they told me it was fixed, I still couldn't get a connection.2. They have a strict policy of only allowing one access card per room, very inconvenient considering you need the access card to access your floor from the elevator.3. No children's pool. Don't leave your young ones unsupervised at the pool area.4. Breakfast lacked variety, and sitting places are limited. You may need to wait if you are late.5. This is no fault of the hotel, but as a soccer fan I was massively disappointed to find that they did not have any TV channels showing the World Cup finals nor was it showing in the hotel lounge/bar.\n",

      "  review_body : my 1st night in Bali was quite an experience. we arrived around 9pm without our luggage because the airline misplaced it. The staff at the counter is accommodating, they offered to call me as soon as my luggage arrives. The room is not big but just nice for the night. My room window is facing the back of the hotel, with greens and a nice view of the surrounding building. the only thing i find not so nice is the fire escape notice behind the door, it is placed too high and i have to tip toed to view it, fyi, i'm 1.68m, so i guess you have to be at least 1.75m to be able to view the fire escape route at eye level.The breakfast spread is good, we have a mixture of continental breakfast and local dishes.the hotel is very near to St.Francis Xavier church, so if you're a Catholic and wishes to attend Sunday English mass, you can do so here. it's just 5 min walk. There is also a new hypermart across the road.\n",

      "  review_body : This hotel is like a factory they have so many guests. There's loud nightclub style music blaring by the pool so loud you wouldn't even want to swim in it. The toilets near the pool were so dirty I don't think they'd ever been cleaned. We tried to rent a scooter from the hotel, they had only one available in bad condition with 2 helmets that were cracked and broken. When we asked for better helmets they said it was the hotel's standard. I asked for a drop off to the airport and they told me it would cols 350,000 IDR so we took a taxi instead which cost 40,000. The one afternoon we tried the pool we were told there were no pool towels available for another hour so we went back to the room where they had taken our towels while cleaning the room but not replaced them. So we were cold and dripping wet and rang reception for towels and they took over 20 minutes to sent them. We were out from 8am to 5pm one day and they only made up the room after we got back. The toilet was filthy when we arrived into the room. When I asked for a double bed the manager immediately took out the conditions to underline that I hadn't requested one. I said fair enough, I had presumed 2 adults in a double occupancy room would have a double but now that I was there could she change us to a double bed room and she wasn't even nice about it, just underlined the rules and didn't bother trying to help. The bedroom windows don't open at all so the room stinks of cleaning products like in a hospital and it gets incredibly stuffy. The buffet breakfast looks great but we found nothing that tasted nice at all. Also the hotel's not near Kuta at all, on a big highway that's quite dangerous and difficult to drive on.\n",

      "  review_body : Hotel is very conveniently located in between big malls Lippo Mall and Discovery Mall, walkable distance to those malls, Waterboom, Kuta beach, lots of convenient stores, lots of famous cafes and restaurants in Kuta, naming: BubbaGump,etc. We were surprised, with such affordable price, the hotel is indeed very nice, feels like 4.5star hotels! (definitely not a Budget hotel at all). Room is clean with modern interior, not too small, and the toilet is amazingly quite big. My best fave is the swimmingpool and Cabanaz by the pool. Next was the SPA and massage service. Although they only have 2therapist (thus we must book in advance), with such affordable price, we get very satisfying body + face massage. A Must!! Bfast is great,my fave is their \"Nasi goreng jawa\" and \"Bread sandwich toast they make it with any filling u like. Nice! none of hotels so far I have found this kind of bfast option in Buffet style :) Overall, I can't wait to come back to Bali staying in this place.\n",

      "  review_body : The Grand Whiz in Kuta is a small boutique hotel that is very middle of the road. It was clean, tidy but very, very small. The rooms had little room left to move around the beds. They were very cramped. The beds were rock hard and also very small. Breakfast was aimed at a middle eastern clientele and on many days limited. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly, but with what they have to work with (a very basic hotel) they were struggling to meet clients expectations.Although well placed on the main road next to the new Lippomart there are better value hotels close by.\n",

      "  review_body : One thing that I do not like about all the hotels and restaurants in Bali is they will give you a \"souvenir\" as a courtesy of giving a feedback of their premises at Tripadvisor. I know it's part of marketing, yet it seems like a bribe to me. Thus, I would not appreciate the little token of appreciation as I wrote what I think. The hotel location is great. It's less than 5-minutes away from the airport by car. Kuta beach, Discovery Mall, Waterboom Park is within walking distance. Mini supermarkets are just around the corner. If you are planning to buy souvenir on the street, do bargain. It's a tourist area. There's a clinic/ hospital next door if there's an emergency. We were welcome with a drink and the hospitality was great. There's a few computers in the reception area which you can use while waiting. The swimming pool was great and cabanas too, just wish that I can dig in. But I was running out of time. We had connecting rooms which was a plus. However, I found that the corner of the rooms to have spiderwebs, the wooden floor was dusty and the towels were kind of worn out. The bathroom also have mold and it's just not what I expect to get. I just closed one eye as I believe this goes back to basic of hotel hospitality- maintaining a premise is important. If I would choose this hotel again in the future, I would really need to think twice. The promotion that was sold on Groupon entitled us to get 15-minute massage which was quite good. You have no obligations to extend if you do not want to. When you walk out from the hotel, there are a few options for you. Breakfast offers Asian and Western selections. Omelet bar is not available on a daily basis. The seating were limited and they basically ask you to wait if the restaurant is full. So, get there early if you do not want to wait.\n",

Room is a little bit small, one tiny size bathroom, one double bed and a little area to walk around the bed and that's all. Internet breaks frequently. When it is connected, the wifi speed is very fast. But when it breaks, you cannot do much but just wait for the signal to show up again. The hotel is easy to miss because its reception is not faced to the road and there is no big sign either. We got a deal for $40/night, breakfast included. With price like that, we cannot complain much. All in all, very happy with the stay. \n",

      "  review_body : Firstly, I would like to say that I was surprising about the hotel because in average I found most of the hotel in Bali in a poor condition. I just pop in to Grand Whiz and saw the difference. The hotel almost new with a good condition. All the facilities make you feel comfortable a specially the location, price and staff. Secondly, I would like to give a big thanks to the all staff working in Grand Whiz. They all walk with a humble smile and serve you very quick. I would not forget the staff named as flowing: 1- Yuliani - FBS 2- Wahyu and Uni they are working in - Restaurant3- and Soquri I don't know if the spelling correct but I think he is a youngest staff. Honestly I wasn't have enough time to thanks them personally and reward them but the is kind of thank letter to them :) Regards\n",

Reception staff was quick and efficient though a bit dissappointed cause we requested superior double with balcony overlooking the pool on our reservation but its fully booked, we only got a room in the corner with a closed balcony.LobbyWas it my eyes or was it dark around lobby in the evening? A bit bright light won't hurt your eys though.The Superior RoomWas it really superior? I thought it was a standard.Bed & sheetsA hard mattress and not properly cleaned white sheets.BathroomClean, good shower, but the water is a bit salty.Swimming pool & barClean, good size, friendly and helpful staffs who brought us pool towels when we requested.BreakyWho said there were no bacon? That's definetely wrong! There was a corner to cook eggs, bacon, and pork sausages as you wish. I asked if i could get beef sausages even its not on their list and they provided it! Awesome. Bacon, eggs, toast, cereal, croissant, juice, coffee, milk, tea will do for an Aussie, mate. You got what you paid, Ta!Local breaky provided chicken soto, fried rice, lodeh with ketupat, and fried noodle. Do not forget to take pudding for your dessert.Overall, its a good hotel for a short stay cause its strategic place near mall, beach, airport, banks, resto. Its not offering unique Balinese But i'll definetely recommend for my friends or collegueas.January 19th, 2014 ~ Bambu Roras Resto & Bar Grand Whiz Kuta Bali\n",

I also like to stay nearby the pool side to enjoy and relax.My best experience is actually their restaurant, because they serve bacon and scrambled eggs on breakfast. I also love their steak, one of the best steak i ever tasted.The second thing is: Im happy that they have express laundry which I can get my laundry within few hours.\n",

However the staff where definitely not as friendly as you may get at other hotels and also my partner and I felt very out of place as we were the only Aussies staying here at this time. We had paid for breakfast to be included daily, however we only went on the first day. Was so disappointing in comparison to other breakfasts I have had elsewhere in Bali. They did not cater for us Australians at all but more Asian dishes which we had never heard of. We also ordered room service numerous times and every time the service was slow and food was not satisfying. When it came to cleaning the room our bed sheets were never changed, we had to request this. Not willing to come back here after having so many better experiences at other hotels in Bali!\n",

      "  review_body : This is the first time i have stayed at this hotel, it is fairly new i think about a year or so old. My first impressions of the hotel were good but soon found out that i didnt like some things about it. If you are australian and are looking to make a couple of friends at the hotel dont expect this because i havent seen any australians and know one speaks good english. The free breakfast you get with the hotel isnt satisfying, you dont get any type of aussie (american) breakfast, no bacon, sausages, beans, hashbrowns. Its all food i havent heard before! The hotel room its self is quite nice but when they come round to clean your room they dont change your bed covers or give you fresh towels. You only get one pillow each and i had to ask about 5 times to get 2 extra pillows. The staff arent really very friendly, i called up room service to get food and about an hour later i called back and they had forgot to bring it up, when i got the food it really wasnt great. Overall i would not want to stay here again and would choose somewhere else.\n",

The hotel is within easy walking distance from Discovery Plaza and the new Lippo Mall. The rooms are new and clean. The finishing is reasonable. The beds are on the firm side and some will find them too hard. Decent sized TV's. The bathroom in a standard room is a bit too small with the door almost hitting the toilet seat. Aircon works well. I use it for one night transfers or a day room. Close to beach access as well. Hotel has WIFI.\n",

      "  review_body : The room was very small with no view - but considering the price I paid, it was acceptable. Bathroom/ toilet was ok but there was no ventilation in the bathroom itself and there was a funny smell - I suspect due to the slight mould in the shower. Water from the tap and shower tasted a bit salty and no matter how long I washed, it felt slippery. I think this is because the water supply is not properly treated. I stayed in other hotels in Bali but did not experience this. I was on a diving trip in a small island where there was no natural fresh water supply once and the water tasted salty too when I showered plus it left a slippery feeling - like you had still soap residue. Probably will not return again. However, if you just need a clean basic room for the night then its fine. \n",

      "  review_body : This is actually our third time to stay at this boutique hotel and I must say it is getting better and more efficient every time!Located in the quieter end of Kartika Plaza across the Ramada, Grand Whiz has the comforts of a 4 star hotel at an affordable price. Amidst the noise of busy Kuta, this hotel is a welcome respite for its grounds are expansive enough to cut out the chaos outside. So voila, you've got the best of both worlds; party time outside and peace and quiet inside the hotel! The inviting blue green tiled swimming pool at the center of the property is most definitely a delight! Couple that with the most scrumptious international daily buffet breakfast! May I just add that the management gives utmost importance to satisfy every cleanliness freak!The tour desk likewise deserves a big applause! Manned by MS SRI, our every question about the island was satisfactorily answered. Our tours around Bali with our safe and friendly driver MR TOBING are composed of happy memories to last a lifetime!Lastly and most importantly is the warm and efficient service of the staff! Big salute to the front office team headed by MR DEK-KO with MS BULAN and MS MILLA plus MS FINA of reservations who granted our ardent wish of being assigned a swimming pool entry room! The friendly and funny service of MR WIRA the bartender must also be commended! Housekeeper MR BUDIANTARA's spotless cleaning skills with a smile is very remarkable!All in all, Grand Whiz Kuta is absolutely a keeper! That's why we've already got a return booking scheduled for mid 2014!\n",

      "  review_body : The Grand is a good choice for Kuta if you want to be away from the action along Legian street.The rooms are big, with all the amenities, including bottle water each day. Excellent wifi. Very friendly staff. Nicely priced for what you get; a good value for the money.Very complete buffet breakfast, which I added each day for 75,000IDR. Pool area what you would expect in a hotel like this. A fine choice of restaurants, easily walkable, in either direction from the hotel.\n",

      "  review_body : The check in process was great, free wifi throughout the hotel, our room was on the first floor overlooking the pool with our own balcony I found this to be noisy in the morning when other hotel users were in the pool yelling and screaming very early.. The food was nice, hotel was clean our beds were very hard so we asked if they could make softer this was no problem.. The hotel is in walking distance from discovery mall and has many stalls around we hired a DVD player down the road just past Febris hotel which cost $2-50 a day. The best massage place when you go out from the hotel is the lady's wearing orange shirts, the breakfast didn't have a big selection but was ok.I would stay at this hotel again as the staff are very friendly and helpful..Thanks to all staff at Grand Whiz\n",

The safety in the room was terrible when during the night me and my husband just realized that the air con was broke and it was really hot with temperature 16 celcius. The worst part i almost slip out at night since the water was suddenly everywhere like a flood as the air con was broke. Its not over yet, when we checked out, the receptionist was accusing us loosing a towel, when we explained that it was carried by the housekeeping who was cleaning of the mess and i explained that i almost fall out, all receptionist people would even bother to ask a apologize about our inconvenience, they just asked us to wait to ensure that all amenities are still there. Other than, the breakfast is average, we experienced with one waitress that impolitely refused bringing us a coffee and water, but she instead bring all drinks to foreigner tourist. Really racism!\n",

      "  review_body : Stay was 2 nights. Initially, I requested for a quiet room with large bed and was given the fifth floor room but after realising that the airconditioning is pointing on the bed, i requested to change the room. I was then given the 1st floor room with no view at all, facing a high wall fence. Room was small compared to other hotels with that rate. Room ambience is a bit dark, perhaps because of the dark tiles. Room itself is clean but not the bathroom, could see algaes in the corner floor tiles. Some fixtures in the bathroom need repairs. Internet access in the room is ok at times, bed is too firm. In the room, can hear noises of chairs being dragged from upstair rooms.Hotel is quite far from Kuta Central but along the walk can see many things. Many minimarkets, restaurants and spas along Kartika Plaza Road. Also there are rental of motorbikes/cars. Only costs Rp.50,000.- per day to rent a bike which is so convenient to get around Kuta. If you are solo or couple traveller the motorbike is the best way to go around. Cars may often stuck in traffic jam.\n",

      "  review_body : Stayed for 3 nights. Arrived 8am from Mnl Cebu Pacific flight. Check in wasn't till after 1pm so my husband & I rented a scooter from the hotel tour desk (idr 80,000/day -which i later found out was a bit high) to go around Kuta. Was able to get into our room at 1pm. Aircon was great and cold! Room was a fair size with all the amenities ie safe deposit box, lcd tv, free wifi but need to sign in every 10min. Room was clean and bathroom was very clean. Bed was firm and comfortable. We had a small balcony with a pool view. Our sheets had a little stain but i could tell the sheets were washed but the stains just didnt come out. I called housekeeping and they changed it right away.Overall I like the hotel. We got a free 15 min free massage. It was sooo good got hooked and availed of the 1.5 hr package.\n",

      "  review_body : Had stayed here in April for 3 nights. It was a pleasant stay. Location to the beach and shopping mall is 10 mins walk. Staffs: Always smiling when we approached them. Greeted us whenever we sees them. Speak good English. We didn't have any problems with them.Rooms: We stayed in a standard room without balcony. Was small as there were 3 single beds for us. Beds are comfortable but I found a stain on my bedsheets. Extra pillows can be provided upon request. A bit dusty at the corners of the rooms so I placed my suitcase over it. Was small thus for 3 ladies with 3 suitcases, we had to put on the seat provided and on the floor. Free water top up every day but I suggested to go to the mini-marts just beside the hotel to get a big bottle (it's cheap too). During the 1st night, we had troubles in sleeping due to the faulty air con. Went to the service counter the next mrng and it was fixed when we came back in the night. Toilets: Clean. Shower rooms and sinks were a bit cramp. Clean towels were supplied each time we asked for room service.Pools: Clean and relaxing. Just beside the bar so nice music was played during our swim.Massage: Had visited the parlour on our last day of travel. Surprisingly good! My friends and I dozed off during the massage (the others massages we went were not that comfortable). There is a bathroom in the room so showering post massage is available. Cheap too. Had to book in advance as there is not enough masseurs available esp. at evening. Food: Breakfast served differently each day. Had my eggs cooked just the way I wanted. Dinner was great too. Had satisfying full stomach to kick start the day each day.Will stay there if I'm going to stay in kuta. Thanks Grand Whiz!\n",

Balcony maybe 3mtr x 1mtr no chair, good for a smoker. Only other place to sit was in the foyer. Breakfast good. Not a lot of sun on pool lounges because enclosed by rooms and wall.Ok for 1 or 2 nights if you have shopping before a flight as quick taxi ride to airport.\n",

      "  review_body : It is indeed a pleasure to stay in your hotel. From may 25th to 28th we felt your warm hospitality. I believe the next time a come back you will surely one of the 5 star hotels there. with your amenities like the restaurant and swimming pool plus your service to your clients such as the respectful, graceful and friendly staff you will meet the higher standards. Thank you for helping my friend in times of need. I will miss the serenity of Bali, not just the place more important the people we've met. Please extend my gratitude to the staffs who assisted us. The front Desk staffs who never failed to answer our querries. The the respectful man who clean our room. The guards who make sure that we're safe. To the one whose in charge of the food ( by the way I like the omelette and rendang). To the staffs who serve the food in the restaurant who always smile. In addition, the man who sang our songs.Thank you and God bless you all!!!salamalaykum!!!Sincerely yours,Ms Clarisil C Alajas\n",

      "  review_body : Stayed here for four nights last April. Overall, I would say that our stay was superb, we got value for our money. The hotel is very well located. Convenience stores, money changers and restaurants are a short walk from the hotel. Discovery mall is a bit farther up the road but still within walking distance. A big plus for the hotel is its proximity to the airport, it took no more than 15 minutes for us to get there upon flying in.The rooms were clean and well kept. The beds are comfortable ensuring a good nights sleep. Aircon in our room took a bit longer to cool the room compared to the kid's adjoining room but this was not much of a bother. Toiletries are provided in the bathroom as are hot and cold showers. Our room had a great view of the pool which our kids really enjoyed swimming in.Another plus for this hotel is the staff. They were very friendly and accomodating starting from the booking of the rooms until the day we left for home. They were always ready with a smile and a helping hand. They were very helpful in recommending places to visit in Bali and arranging transportation for us.Breakfast was adequate, A salad bar with fresh fruits, an egg station complement the different kind of foods served. Staff were very attentive although you might have difficulty finding a table during breakfast rush hour.Can't comment on the spa as we didn't get to try it out. Will definitely stay here again when i go back to Bali.\n",

Couldnt hear much from the pool as we didnt see any kids on hotel during our 10 day stay. The rooms are very clean and no mould or water damage in bathroom how ever the beds are like sleeping on a concrete plank. Very hard and no springs. Breakfast is average, fresh fruits and hot food are nice and an egg station which is great. But seating is an issue as there arent many seats. Staff are very pleasant and polite. Air con works well and gets very cold! Mini bar fridge stays quite warm not very cold. Very value for money and its not that far out from everything. I reccomend staying here for shopping and partying people :) wifi is a big let down as more than one person in room cant accsess at once. \n",

We met small or big groups staying at the same time, so yes, in occasional time, like breakfast and check out, its pretty crowded in front office,everyone is standing there, very not convenience.For tour group, this hotel is great, cheap and new and stylish, but for my personal taste, not going coming back again, its too crowd to go for breakfast or to go lazy by the pool because people wandering around watching.the breakfast is average and the coffee disappointing, but the croissant is yummyNo banana pancakes, or should there be a special breakfast order? no ideathe nearest beach is Kuta beach but it takes a long walk to get there with traffic and the weather, you better paid short taxi fare. you can take taxi to the beach, airport, shops or find something to eat. But if you fit , you may try to take a slow walk which take approximately 30 minutes to the beach.\n",

      "  review_body : We requested ground floor pool side for the first two nights then interconnecting rooms for the last 6. We got 3rd floor for the first two nights overlooking the pool however the 'balcony' was about a foot wide. Come afternoon, the sun screams through the window so our room was disgustingly hot when we got in so leaving the blinds open was not an option anyway. At first we were told interconnecting rooms weren’t available and that our 14 year old daughter would be in a totally separate room across the hallway. This wasn’t acceptable at all to us so reception juggled a few things around and got us ground floor connecting rooms - there are only 6 rooms that open to the pool - none of these are interconnecting. An hour later we were told we could have the interconnecting rooms for only4 nights and then one of the rooms would have to be vacated 'for other guests' .. Not happy .. I asked about a suite which they explained would be 750,000 rp per night which seemed reasonable however they would not refund the money i'd paid for the two rooms they were kicking us out of !!! \"You get that back from your agent\" I queried why we had to leave our room because another (obviously more valued) customer was coming in that day and suggested perhaps that customer can start in a different room and move once we had left. They told me that they were sorry but someone has booked that room. In the end I voiced my opinion and got a phone call and hour later saying would could stay in the connecting rooms.The rooms have NO storage. Once you put your suitcase on the bench that’s it. No drawers/cupboards. There is hanging space for about 4 things. My hubby’s case was on the floor and given the basic rooms are tiny there is very little space for anything let alone a suitcase. The bathrooms are a good size though !The beds are like sleeping on an overstuffed couch - there is no innerspring mattress (I even pulled the sheets back to make sure it wasn’t a plank of wood) they are so hard and despite the manager replying on Trip Advisor to every post that they are looking at this problem nothing has been done. Wifi on the 3rd floor room was perfect but none in our room on the ground floor. Anywhere around the lobby/pool area is fine. The entire pool area is in shade after lunch because it is surrounded by 4 floors of the hotel. No good if you want to work on your tan.Breakfast is a debacle. Catered for the Asian market complete with some funky looking bacon (?) for your omelettes, however if you want real bacon they will bring some out to you. First morning there surrounded by clovey cigarettes smokers. We were directed to the upstairs area which is apparently 'non smoking' Obviously no one told the smokers that so again subjected to more smokers. When I asked the staff to tell them to stop smoking I was told non smoking was downstairs and I could move if i'd like !! Our last breakfast there were 3 tour buses lined up out the front to take what seemed like the entire hotel on their daily jaunts. We turned around and went back to our room. There simply isn’t enough space in the restaurant and you have a single person sitting at a table for 3 - when there is single seats around the place. Our daughter was very ill during our stay and I ordered breakfast in the room – it was delightful !! Should have not paid for the breakfast in our package nd just got room service each day.Our motorbike had been used by, we suspect one of the staff members, since they have security in the underground carpark and at the top of the ramp. How did we know someone had used it.. because they left their shorts under the seat!!! Yes it had been locked and the key was in our room – the only night we walked to dinner and our bike was used by someone else. The CCTV apparently showed a car was in the way so they were unable to identify the shorts wearing motorbike user. Hope he got his shorts back !Grand whiz is cheap and clean but you get what you pay for and thankfully we only stayed for the 8 days.\n",

      "  review_body : Had 3 nights at the grand whiz with my family, and we had a great time. The location is near the airport about 5 min from Discovery mall and 10 min from Kuta square. We wanted a hotel in this location having stayed in a quiet place previously, so we were not disappointed. The hotel itself is new, very nicely designed common areas, lovely staff and a great pool. The room itself is small but well decorated and appointed. It was a bit mall for me, my wife and son (who slept on the floor in a travel cot), however it would be fine for a couple.\n",

      "  review_body : Stayed here for 3d/2n, the interior of the room is dominant with brown color which gives warm atmosphere, the mattress is hard but it is okay for us, just lack of pillows( would be better if each person get 2 pillows to have better support of the neck on this hard mattress). Love the pool as it is not too small and clean.The breakfast has enough varieties thus taste average.The location is good since u can walk to Discovery Mall, Kuta Beach,etc. Many restaurants n bars are within walking distance. Spas ,massages and mini markets are easily found.The service n hospitality of the staffs are average. Wifi in bedroom is not stable,have to re-enter the login n password regularly many times .\n",

      "  review_body : Was dissapointed when our transfers did not collect us from the airport and i had to arrange with taxi company but atleast they arranged transfers back at end of stay.Ive seen alot of reports to say the hotel is clean, even though this was some what true it was dissapointing to see all the built up grime in the shower corners or the window drapes stained and also the bed linen was changed for a stained set ...We had 2 rooms with our boys next door but the doors wouldnt even close properly as the latch was installed incorectly.The pool was clean but i would not recomend to stay here if you had teenagers unless you had another family to interact with. A games room with a pool table or other games would also help keep the kids occupied or even a gym. We were told not to hang our wet bathers off the balcony as it went against their standard ( what about the dirty drap standard !).The showers would not drain away properly and almost flood the whole bathroom and we were told this was normal.I was also supprised to find that WIFI was not available in the rooms.Even though we had two people in each room they would only leave one toothbrush for each room so i suppose we were ment to share ??The beds were way too hard, the rooms were small but then again i felt they were sufficent just to sleep or escape the heat for a period of time during the day.The baclony could do with a couple of chairs to relax and enjoy the pool view when the kids are having a swim.I do not wish to sound negative as the staff were friendly .\n",

I was really happy, great service, great location, great swimming pool, safe environment Hotel is very quiet despite being in the centre of Kuta.

Hotel itself very close to the airport, consider in Kuta area yet it also near to Discovery and Waterbom.The check-in was very fast and without problems. We got a Superior room with pool view and it was great. The room was enough for two people, clean, enough lighting and also good bathroom. Internet also available inside the room but we need to request cable for it. No wifi but internet was fast enough for us.During 5 days staying, the staff was always friendly, greeted us everytime we pass by.For the food, we didnt try. Not so breakfast person, so we cant comment any of that.Location was good,near to 24 hours mini mart. 10-15 minute walk to Kuta beach and Legian area.\n",

Our children enjoyed here because there are connecting door to other room (this package contains of 2 superior room). Nothing special for the breakfast, hotel location near airport and supermarket. But we really disappointed for the spa. Actually we've got free 15 minutes massage (part of the package) but it's so hard to get it, there are so many excuse every time I ask for the service. And finally until I leave the hotel I still can't get it, very disappointed!\n",

      "  review_body : We stayed here for 7 nights. We booked a Superior Room with Asia Rooms. Checkin was smooth and fast. Our room was overlooking the Pool. The room is small but we have stayed in smaller at other hotels. Room is clean and has flat screen tv. Bed is hard but when your tired it doesnt worry you! Internet is ok if your by the pool area but not in your room you need a cable if u want good Internet and connect it to your laptop. There are 3 computers to use downstairs free of charge. Location of hotel is ok it's not far to Centro shopping centre. Breakfast is poor,omelettes are made in bulk and put in the warmer they are not made to order like at other hotels. Omelettes should be made on the sport as people want them otherwise they go cold,they have no flavour and taste bland. There is no bacon for breakfast either. They have cereals and little pastries,bread,fruit and mainly Asian Foods which is boring for those who don't eat Asian food for breakfast. It can become boring and bland after a few days. Our room was quiet most nights until the fire alarm would be set off by someone obviously smoking! I don't think we would stay here again even though the staff are friendly and it's a clean hotel. Thank you anyway for providing us with a clean hotel and a bed to sleep on Kind regards\n",

      "  review_body : I recently stayed at the Grand Whiz for 6 nights with my partner over Christmas. Overall the hotel was very good, however I will explain the the pro's and con's:PRO's- Very convienient location. Walking distance to Centro shopping Centre, Water Bom Park, Kuta Square, Matahai Shopping Centre- 24/7 Shop next door- Very quiet hotel, not noisy at all- Fantastic food menu, didnt try the breakfast however ordered room service 3 times and it was delicious. Make sure you try the Kung Pao - sooo good and all items very cheap too!- Beautiful pool area- Easy check in and check out, including the hotel letting us leave our luggage after we checked out before our flight later in the day- Very helpful and friendly staff- Clean and lovely room- 5 Min drive from the airport- Room overlooking the pool- For the quality of this hotel the price is very cheap!!CON's- REALLY uncomfortable bed! I am not fussy however this bed was sooooo hard I had to check that hadnt forgot to put the matress on...- The pool (although beautiful) was very shallow and only went up to my chest (and I am short) so probably more aimed at children. Also closes at 9pm.- Although we had a beautiful balcony overlooking the pool area there was no table and chairs on the balcony so couldnt sit out there which was a bit disapointingOverall a great hotel in a great location and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay however they definately need to think about doing something about the beds.\n",

      "  review_body : Stayed at this hotel for a week over the Christmas period with my boyfriendand we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We had a pool facing, lower level room so that we could open up right on to the pool-it was lovely. The staff are friendly, our check-in was easy and the food we had at the hotel was really good! The location of the hotel is ideal, it's quiet but then just close enough to the hustle and bustle! Rooms are on the smaller side but the rooms are nice and to be honest we didn't stay in the hotel too much so the room size wasn't a problem. The breakfast is catered more to asian cuisine but there is simething for everyone. The hotel is very clean and new! The pool is lovely, not the biggest but not many people hang around and stay in the pool so we found we had it to ourselves most days. The other thing is the pool is shaded throughout most of the day because of how the building is constructed around it so its nice to escape the sun! Well unless you are trying to get a tan of course! I will definite be coming back to this hotel in future as it really is in an ideal location!\n",

      "  review_body : Stayed during early Dec for 7 days, with our son. Very NICE CLEAN hotel located right on Karthika Plaza road (this is the main road in KUTA), extremely near to the airport (about 5-6 minutes by car). Opt for a pool facing-highfloor room (the hotel has Lobby + 4 levels). We stayed in # 5112 (Superior Room) overlooking the pool - Just perfect. Upside- Centrally located @ Kuta.- close proximity to Airport (5-6 minutes by cab). Walking distance to Kuta beach, Discovery mall, Water Bom (water amusement park & rides), - the hotel provides complimentary bicycles (they have a total of 3 bicyles provided free on 1st come basis)- pool is just perfect not too huge- good for lazying around. Pool towels are provided & kept next to the Bar counter.- All staff are extremly keen in providing a prompt service & ever smiling. Everyone were eager to welcome us: the HK boys in the corridor, Maintenace guys, Reception Staff, Bar staff, Travel Counter, the Security guards.- The hotel travel desk facilitated bike hiring, day trip to Kintamani tour, WaterBom tickets (actually, the tickets were discounted by 2 USD for Adults & 1 USD for Child when purchased at the hotel travel counter)- Bathroom is spacious & well planned (except for one of the walls that had glazed/clear (60%/40%) glass that looks into the room)- Basement parking : This was of help to us as we had hired bike for multiple days.- Extremely good internet connectivity: Free wifi in lobby area. Room is only cable internet; ask for the rj45 cable.- Our room had an inroom safe locker. Not sure if this is the case for all room categories.- Hotel arranged a airport drop for 50K RPDownside- Make sure that that information is communicated correctly & received to/from the hotel staff as we had couple of error due to communication gaps on billing,etc.- We had heavy rains on the day 6 & the water did seep in through the balcony door. Glad we were in the room to report this to the reception who promptly cleaned up the mess.- No hanging of clothes in the balcony (this was an irritant as the hotel policy does not allow for hanging clothes on the balcony due to asthetic reasons!!) combined with no alternate for hanging inside the room was extremly cumbersome. This was addressed thought as they quickly provided line in the bathroom.- one wall of the bathroom is convered by the glazed glass which does not help if you have young children. They could have provided curtains to cover the glass in circumstances when children are around. Works good for couples though.While the downsides are just situation that we faced during the 7 days stay & albeit may be trivial in nature. We plan to stay in this hotel during our next visit as well. On scale of 10, it's a 9/10 overall. The hotel has some interesting/lower room rates/packages on its websites.\n",

      "  review_body : We got a promo rate from hoterip.com, plus we utilized our hoterip point, made our one night stay at Grand Whiz without breakfast costs only IDR 300,000! We made a phone call to the hotel few days before our arrival date. It was our first booking using hoterip, and we wanted to ensure that our room is ok. We also asked the hotel staff to provide us a room with swimming pool view.The chek in was fast, we presented our voucher, and we got a room facing the pool. Other review stated that the room was small, but for us it was ok. We got plenty of place to do our moslem prayer. There was a TV cable with various channels. The negative thing about the room was the bed, it was way too hard. The swimming pool was great, too bad it was too small that on Sunday morning, the pool was full. We had to take turn to swim from one side to other side.The hotel located only 10 minutes from the airport, but staying in Kuta meaning you have to pass really bad traffic jam to go to tourist spots or to go back to your hotel. If you are ok with the traffic jam, then it's ok to stay here, But if you don't want to be stuck in the traffic jam, better you stay in Seminyak area.\n",

      "  review_body : We stayed here for 2 weeks at the end of September to the 8th October 2012. The room was lovely and the staff were very accommodating with any requests. While the breakfast buffet wasnt overly large,there was a good variety of food, and the chefs were quick to whip you up fresh cooked eggs or omelette if you wanted...and they have real bacon there too lol.We just had a regular room and it was lovely and clean,with a nice big shower with lots of room.Its in a good location for those who want to be close to everything but not caught up in all the clubs.Its just down from the big discovery shopping mall and waterbom,within walking distance or a quick 5000 rupia cab ride.I would definitely recommend this hotel and I have and we will also stay here again. Thanks everybody for a very pleasant stay.Marie and Jesse Skodt.\n",

      "  review_body : Stayed here 4 nights in late October with my girlfriend. Our stay was so good we came back to Bali at the end of our Indonesia trip and stayed again at the Grand Whiz, and the experience was consistant.Our stay was so pleasant, the staff here are so polite, always smiling and ready to answer your questions/assisit you.The rooms are very comfortably sized, & very clean. Same goes for bathroom, VERY clean. The cleaners clean the room as if it was fresh for a new guest everyday. You can tell this hotel takes pride in its self.We will really miss this place, the nicest (and cheapest) hotel we stayed in our travels through Indonesia.The hotel is conveniently located close enough to the airport, and also close to Kuta area.Walked to Kuta beach everyday, maybe a 10 minute enjoyable walk (you like massage? no massage... ok thank you!)honestly though, even if you dont like walking - taxis are cheap in Bali, and VERY easy to get (dont worry theyll find you...)like 30,000-40,000 IDR to get to Seminyak.Even though its close to Kuta, its great because its pretty calm at night, so you can sleep easy.Would recommend this place to anyone travelling to Bali.At such a great price, you truly get 5 star service. I will definitely return on my next trip to Bali.Thank you for the amazing time Grand Whiz!\n",

As I spent little time in my room it was all I needed. Sure the rooms are small but I found it quite adequate. It was clean and well maintained. The staff are super friendly and attend to your any whim. I love the position as it is just near the Discovery shopping mall and a couple of minutes walk to the beach and minutes to the airport. I would have no hesitation in staying there again and would recommend it .\n",

      "  review_body : we only stay for 1 night therefor we choose this hotel because its near the airport ( only 5 mins drive ). the location is good, near mall, tourist attraction, beach. i saw the concept of this hotel is budget and minimalist hotel. the staffs are great and friendly. i have no problem with the lobby and the check in process, was quick and they let us check in before check in-time. the pool was ok, yes its near the lobby, so many people walk by but i think it wasn't a problem, if you dont want people see you swim, just swim in the bathtub. its BALI not many hotel has pool on roof top. ok, now about the room, yes its very small indeed, if you wanna stay more than 3 days, you better dont stay here, not really comfortable for long stay. the bed is awful, its so hard. the pillow, blanket, AC, TV are ok. the room floor, well not clean enough many sands. bathroom is small and clean, no complain for the water and the heater, they work well. oh the breakfast, we dont have chance to try, because have to catch early morning flight. overall, it was ok, you'll get what you paid for.\n",

      "  review_body : I seen so many good reviews on here and had my hopes up. I realise now they offer you a souviner if you put a review on whilst you are there, so most would say positive things. Im going to let you know what i wish i knew before staying. Firstly the service and staff were amazing, no complaints. The room was small, and after ten days felt like a prision and the view outside my window was awful. The bathroom was tiny. The bed was like laying on a bed frame, extremely hard. Very small tv. There were ants everywhere in our room and i was worried about customs as i am sure there were ants in our bags.The pool is half the size you imagine it to be. I didnt like the location of it as the many tourists who sat in the lobby all day every day made you feel uncomfortable with swimming. The spa didnt even have manicures! Even though it was stated on their brochure. The breakfast was the worst part of my stay. If you are asian the breakfast is perfect. If you are western, very limited. I did not eat breakfast for 7 days i found it appalling. Also we had tea one night and did not get free appertizer or desert like promised on board outside.Wifi didnt work in bedroom so that made stay super boring. Overall i would not recommend or stay again. I felt ripped off and that they only catered for asian tourists.Location was perfect.\n",

I find the hotel really great with friendly staff, everyone greats you each morning and whenever they see you during the day.Breakfast was great with lots of choices local and western.Not many Western hotels would cater for Asian tourists let me tell you. Room had a huge king sized bed again not many Western hotels would have that for a regular room. All in all very convenient for the main street of Kuta if you are here for shopping and seeing the sights. The beach is a ten minute walk on the road so it is not far.Very happy with my stay\n",

      "  review_body : We booked 2 rooms for 4 nights and it was the right choice. If you are looking for a comfortable and clean hotel, then the Grand Whiz will not disappoint. It has been in operation for only 9 months so it is still relatively new but everything works and we were certainly happy with our stay. Beds were comfortable and the room size was okay for us. If you are someone used to a large sized room, then you may find this small in comparison.Breakfast was good with a decent selection each morning. However,it does get crowded though we did not have to wait to secure a table the mornings we were there.Our package came with one meal free 'nasi goreng\" (fried rice) and it was good-well done, tasty and not oily.Location wise, it is NOT fronting the beach. A 15-20 mins walk will take you there. Discovery shopping mall/SOGO is approx 500 meters from the hotel. You can watch the beautiful sunset at the beach at the rear of the mall (enter the mall and find your way to the rear). Be there by 6pm.Overall, a very enjoyable and pleasant stay. Will stay again.\n",

      "  review_body : When I was staying there for 3 nights last week, the hotel was convenient, looks new and clean and the pool was nice.However, the service from the staff was very poor. For example: we have payed the total room charge for 3 nights, one month before to secure the room for us. When I checked in, the hotel guy in the receptionist told if I had not payed the room while he checked the computer.Secondly, the bell boy seemed not have a good sense for the customers.We brought all of our luggage when arrived in the hotel, and thank god, the security person helped us to bring the luggage in the lobby.Even one day, after we had our shopping, I took the hotel cart by myself to bring our goods.After few minutes, the bell boy showed and offered a help.The breakfast was really ordinary, and the food were contaminated with Balinese traditional spices which not everyone like. And the restaurant was really small, we almost did not find any table to eat (I once thought to eat like standing-party, but not for my children and mom.The hotel was located not close enough from Kuta Beach and Discovery Mall.So you have to walk far enough to get to the beach or the mall.We will not go back to this hotel again.Thanks.\n",

Good location - near the airport, at the edge of Kuta, and only a 10 min walk to Discovery Mall. The staff were very nice and helpful. They even helped us hire a car and driver so we could get around.The rooms were a little small but had all the amenities including satellite tv, safe, wifi and kettle. The wifi was a bit spotty from our room on the 2nd floor but worked perfectly in the lobby, pool and restaurant area. They even have some computers for guests to use.

I arrived at around 5pm and it was quite hot still I was greeted by the amazing staff with a cold towel and refreshing drink!! I was escorted to my gorgeous room by a man called Ray what can I say about Ray he was more then helpful with everything I needed! As I was staying by myself at this hotel he would walk me to my room when he was on at night! The food was exquisite one of the best meals I had in Bali! I would reccomend this hotel to anyone as I was there with family who were staying at the hotel across the road it was too expensive for me alone and the grand whiz was perfectly priced and situated right where I needed! All in all I had an amazing stay here and will be going back for sure!! 10/10\n",

      "  review_body : Me and my family get an advantage while staying in Grand Whiz Kuta. We booked 4 standart rooms around 3 months ago. But when got here, they only have 3 standart rooms left, and due to this fully booked reason, 1 room has been upgrade into deluxe room with pool access, without any charges. Woooww.. How lucky we are. My nephew and nieces are very glad about it. Got 2 nights stay in pool-sided room. They can reach the pool easily. We have so much fun and really enjoy to stay here.The room is clean and comfort. Big enough for 2 adults and 1 child. Really good for family. Small working desk and wi-fi available in the room. This hotel also have delicious breakfast, friendly staff, beautiful swimming pool and best location. Near with Discovery Mall, Waterboom and Kuta Beach. Definitely will stay here again when i visit Bali next time.\n",

      "  review_body : Our flight was scheduled to land at Denpasar at midnight so we decided to find a hotel close to the airport for our first night and then workout the rest of our trip over breakfast. The online booking process was straight forward, we organised an airport pick up and breakfast was included in the room rate a total of about AUD$65. Our driver was front and centre waiting for us at the airport, the vehicle was brand new and the trip to the hotel only took about 15 minutes. Check in could not have been easier the process was quick and painless. We were impressed by the interior design of the restaurant and reception area and this continued throughout the hotel. The rooms are a little small but big enough for two people and quite (perfect for a good nights sleep). No complaints about the quality of the room which still has that new feeling. Breakfast was great, a mix of both western and Asian staples. The location is in the southern end of Kuta and an easy walk to everything. We would happily book with Grand Whiz again for that first or last night stay in Bali. A great little hotel close to the airport\n",

This morning I asked them to make me eggs benedict....yesterday I asked for bacon. Free breakfast is really free....ala carte are also free!

      "  review_body : I thought this is a good hotel because when I see the photos on the internet, it looks like a big hotel that have spacious rooms. Unfortunately, when I stay in superior rooms, the size of the room is quite similar to the standard room in other 3 star hotels. Also the size of the bathroom is too small for a 3 star hotel. The room rate per night is also expensive I think. It is like a rate in the 4 star hotel. The location is also quite far from Kuta beach. It takes 15-20 minutes to walk to Kuta beach. The closest one is the Discovery Mall and Waterboom park. It only takes 5-10 minutes walking to reach these two places. The staffs are not bad, but the receptionist are not too welcome to the local tourists, may be because local tourist usually do not have a lot of money. The other disappointing matter is the breakfast. Truly, it is like a breakfast in the 2 star hotel. There are no variety in the menu from day to day and the choice of food and drink is very few. It's horrible. There are only two great things about this hotel. First, it is very close to the airport, only 15-20 minutes by taxi in a traffic congestion. Second, the design of the building and the room is interesting, because it is modern and minimalist. Overall, I would suggest travelers not to take this hotel if they could find other 3 star hotel with the same rate and closer to Kuta beach.\n",

Still, it is only 5 minutes walk from dining places, Bali Discovery Mall, another 5-10 minutes will take you to Hard Rock, beach and Made Warung which seems to be the must go for a lot of tourists. Staff were friendly and greeted us with big smile though we must have arrived around 10pm. Room was perfect for 2. It was clean, cosy and bed was comfortable. We even had a cake and rose petal on bed for our honeymoon. They have the newer version of TV, hence you can plug your tablet/external harddisk on for your favourite movies through the HDMI cable if you decide to stay in. Otherwise there are quite a few English channels to choose from. Renovation was taking place at the opposite road but there was no issue for us as we were tucked away at the inner block.\n",

      "  review_body : I stayed at the Grand Whiz Hotel in Kuta, Bali, from the 12th of June to the 14th of June, and was in town this time for business.I am so thoroughly impressed by my stay at the hotel, and will do my best to write out the experiences that made my stay here so memorable.Firstly, the rooms are very new and well-designed (the Hotel was recently built, and apparently has only been operating for about four months). The beds themselves may seem tough at first, but boy do they provide a wonderful night's sleep! This was extremely helpful for the meetings that I had in the morning. Furthermore, I had a breathtaking pool view from my room (2212, you should request if possible!), where I was able to see the sparkling pool water, framed by the palm trees and poolside bar.Secondly, this hotel pays such attention to detail. Grand Whiz Kuta hits the nail on the head to the saying \"everything is in the details\"... During my first day, I accidentally made a small tear in the curtains and immediately wrote a note to remind myself to notify housekeeping. That said, though I had totally forgotten about the note, I returned the next day to find my curtains repaired, and the note by my bed-side table gone! Also, I had left my wet swimwear and dirty laundry on the floor of my toilet earlier today, yet, I was so pleasantly surprised to find my soiled laundry well folded, and placed in a laundry bag by housekeeping when I returned! The service here is truly impressive.In terms of the breakfast provided, I must admit that they are currently lacking in their offerings for Western food, though the congee was good (I tried both Asian and Western plates during my stay). That said, I was pleasantly surprised (again), when I decided to dine in for lunch today-- Grand Whiz's alacarte food is superb for a three-star restaurant! I've never been a fan of salads, but they had this salad (made of tropical oranges, and layered with medium-rare beef), which was refreshing and delicious (strongly recommended). If anything, the food on the hotel’s menu is definitely a good choice.As a swimmer, their pool was long enough to accommodate my work-out session (doing backflips helps :)). The pool water was warm when I swam (around 4-5pm), and is great for just splashing about (saw a few kids use it). If swimming's not your thing, the place also has three bikes for rent! A family who had used it in the afternoon told me that they had a \"very good\" time taking them out for a spin :).Lastly, I must mention their in-house spa-- don't let it's simple entrance fool you! It is spacious, stretches inside, and has multiple spacious spa-rooms (for couples and for singles haha)... The price for my 60 minute massage was 349k Rupiah, and was well-worth it-- it easily compared to the massages offered by the other hotels down the road (ramayana and etc.). For me, the quality of the massage, the room-size, and the pricing was definitely well-worth it :). (I'll definitely come back for it when I'm back in town).As I close out, I will definitely be staying at the Grand Whiz Kuta when I return to Bali. I strongly recommend those of you looking for a place to stay to consider giving this \"gem\" a shot!Thanks for everything, and keep up the excellent work!\n",

      "  review_body : I recently stay grand whiz kuta.this hotel is located at kuta beach road, close to kuta water boom.there is a public paving path down to beach from the road through the alley opposite kuta railway station and bar.this location is best for first time bali visitor especially if they arrive late night.this hotel can be reach within few minutes drive from airport. Also, for early birds person can do jogging along the beach to legian and seminyak area.kuta is best location for those who like to do culinary and window shopping. Along the street there are a lot of international and local restaurants.This location is easy to find by taxi and find a metered taxi is recommended for foreigner.I stay at junior suite.the room is large but the sofa bench is a bit small, providing a small pantry will be even better.bath room is large but monoblock seems too small.shower area very slippery.the breakfast menu is disappointing with very few varieties and doesn't taste good. especially for guest who pay suite room they should provide a better breakfast. This hotel is strictly a non smoking room policy and they tell us when guest check in and there is fine when smoking inside the room.this role is worth to follow by other hotels.In general,I can recommend to stay at Grand Whiz.\n",

      "  review_body : Stayed for 5 days.This hotel is quite new located at Jln Kartika, very near to the airport and to the shopping and restaurants areas at Kuta. Few minutes of walk, you can go to the restaurants and shopping complexes and markets. Most of the staffs are very friendly and they tried to accommodate you.Fresh fruit juice and warm towel given during check-in. Need to pay a sum of money for deposit.Like the design of the hotel and the facilities. Swimming pool is just opposite of the bar area and rooms are just opposite to it too.Tried the room service in the hotel, foods are OK. However, there is no menu in the room and so if you want to place a room service, you need to get down to the restaurant and place your order. Comfortable room and bed, with the use of mirrors. You can see the mirrors from all side of the room. Strong Wifi/internet connection in the room, however you need to request for the username and password daily because it expires after 24 hours. You need to request a LAN cable too. There's mini bar, in room electronic safe and other general facilities in the room. Complimentary mineral waters in the room. Aircond was strong indeed, and the toilet and shower were OK.Housekeeping and laundry service were fast and clean. I'm quite satisfied with this stay generally and may stay at here again for the next visit for its service, quality and location.This is a non-smoking hotel, or else you will be fined USD100.\n",

      "  review_body : This newly open hotel in Bali Kuta area is highly recommened. It is located far away enough from the busy and noisy area yet close enough, just 5-10 minutes walk away from shopping mall and Kuta shopping district. The swimming pool and rooms in this hotel is very clean and gives you a very cosy feeling staying there. The staffs are all extremely friendly and approachable. The only thing I could really pick from my stay there is the Breakfast which I expected better servings. However, overall I am extremely happy with my stay there and will stay there again the next time I visit Bali.\n",

      "  review_body : This brand new hotel at Bali's South Kuta has the perfect location for those who are wary of Bali's increasingly notorious traffic. Though 10 minutes to the airport, it's equally convenient to get to the shops and eateries in Kuta and Seminyak. Tuban beach, Waterbom Park and Discovery Mall are also shorts walks away. And, with the many tourist info booths in the locale, it's also ideal as a base for arranging day trips to other parts of Bali (eg Rafting in Ubud, Cycling from Kintamani, etc.).Grand Whiz Kuta is rated 3 stars, but it's obvious that much thought has been put into the decor to provide a better-than-3-stars resort ambience. The attraction for the family was the courtyard pool with it's enticing azure-blue water; just 1.2m deep though but ideal for most kids to play in.Room size is generous for a 3-star, and rendered more spacious by the use of mirrors and appropriately-sized furniture. WCs come with the Japanese style eco-washers, and the good water heating and pressure makes for a fantastic shower after a day of discovering Bali.Service needs brushing up in certain areas, but staff are always smiling and prompt to respond to requests. Given time I'm sure the hotel will deliver the great service that travellers have come to expect from Bali.Overall, a good hotel for family getaways!\n",
